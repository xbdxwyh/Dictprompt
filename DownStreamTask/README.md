This folder contains the datasets of all downstream tasks we used: Word in Context (WiC), Winograd Schema Challenge (WSC), Sense Making (SM) , Sense Making Reasoning (SMR), and HellaSwag

These datasets are all sourced from the official website, so for convenience, we put it here and you can use the functions inside the utils.py file to read the datasets.
