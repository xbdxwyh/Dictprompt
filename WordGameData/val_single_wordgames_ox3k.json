comic in the US means a comic strip or strip cartoon. Comic strips are a series of small drawings, called frames, with words that tell a story. Most US newspapers contain comic strips that are read by both adults and children. On weekdays they are usually four frames long, printed in black and white. On Sundays they are longer and in colour. Comic strips are also popular in British newspapers. Some can be found on the Internet.Most comic strips make jokes about the characters in them and the things that happen to them. For instance, in the  Peanuts strips (1950\u20132000) many of the jokes are about Charlie Brown, who has very bad luck, and his friend Lucy, who is unkind to him. In Calvin and Hobbes (1985\u20131995), the humour comes from the relationship between a boy and his imaginary friend, a toy tiger. Comic strips in British newspapers include  Andy Capp and The Perishers. In the US,  Dilbert is about life in the office while Doonesbury comments on political situations through its characters. Most newspapers also print single frames that comment humorously on politicians and other people in the news.In Britain a comic is a picture magazine, usually for children. Comics contain short stories written as comic strips, and sometimes also competitions and articles. Some parents do not approve of comics, but others argue that they encourage children to read. Popular children\u2019s comics include  Beano,  Dandy, and 2000 AD, which features mainly science fiction stories. Comics for very young children are often based on popular television programmes, such as Thomas and Friends (which features  Thomas the Tank Engine) and  Bob the Builder. Adult comics, such as Viz, are usually very rude.Some of the characters in Beano and Dandy have not changed much over the years and now look old-fashioned. Teachers, for instance, still wear mortar boards (= stiff black hats with a square top), though real teachers stopped wearing them long ago. Many of the most popular comics appear in the form of books, called annuals, around Christmas each year. Comic books are similar to comics. Each book has a set of characters who have adventures.

They provided a cheap and convenient means of transport for heavy goods, especially between the mining and industrial centres of the Midlands and north-west England. Coal, grain, clay and other materials were transported on narrowboats, also called barges, that were pulled along by horses walking along a towpath beside the canal. Many miles of channel had to be dug, with some sections passing through tunnels or over aqueducts. Hundreds of locks were built to enable boats to go up or down a hill. A flight (= series) of 20 or 30 locks was needed on some steep sections.In the US canals were used for a short period to transport goods to areas where there were no large rivers. The most famous, the Erie Canal in New York State, ran from Buffalo on Lake Erie to Albany on the Hudson River and connected New York City with Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Mules, not horses, were used to pull the barges. The growth of the railway in the 1840s soon took business away from the canals, but the canal system played an important role in expanding trade and encouraging people to move west.After the railways were built, many canals were filled in. In Britain especially, canals that still exist have become popular with people wanting a quiet country holiday away from traffic. Old narrow boats have been fitted with motors and converted to provide attractive holiday accommodation. Speed is restricted on canals so the pace is slow and restful. Some locks are operated by lock-keepers, but many are worked (= opened and closed) by people on the boats. Going through a flight of locks is seen as part of the fun. At night, people moor their boats at the side of the canal. Canals are also popular with fishermen, and with walkers using the towpath. Many pubs are built beside canals and attract people enjoying a canal holiday or having a day out.In Britain, some people live in narrow boats and stay most of the time on a particular stretch of canal. These houseboats are often painted in bright colours, with pictures of flowers on the side. On the flat roof there are sometimes traditional jugs and pots painted with similar designs.","3737":"the leader of a group of people, especially a sports team","3783":"resulting from a lack of attention and thought","3818":"to support the weight of sb\/sth and take them or it from place to place;

They are now worn all over the world. Jeans were created during the Gold Rush in the 1840s and 1850s, when many people went to the western US to search for gold. Miners often lived in tents made out of a strong fabric and, because they needed strong clothes, they began to wear trousers made from the same fabric. Many jeans were sold by Levi Strauss, who had a store in California, and today Levi\u2019s are among the most famous jeans.Traditionally, jeans are blue (and are then also called blue jeans), but the fabric they are made of,  denim, comes in many colours. Black jeans, and stonewashed jeans that are made from denim which has been washed until it becomes lighter and softer, are also made. Styles include bell-bottoms, flares and bootleg cut, which are halfway between straight and flared, but straight-leg is most popular as a universal style and worn by both men and women. Designer jeans are sold by top fashion designers.For a long time jeans were worn only for physical work, but in the 1960s society changed and young people began to question traditional attitudes to dress. Jeans were a symbol of these changes and became very popular. Now, people of any age wear jeans because they are comfortable, practical and relatively cheap. They can be made more or less formal, depending on what is worn with them, but some restaurants and wine bars do not allow in people who are wearing jeans, and some companies do not like their staff to wear jeans for work.","14575":"a strong narrow stream of gas, liquid, steam or flame that comes very quickly out of a small opening.
