The word commuting comes from commutation ticket, a US rail ticket for repeated journeys, called a season ticket in Britain. Regular travellers are called commuters.The US has many commuters. A few, mostly on the East Coast, commute by train or subway, but most depend on the car. Some leave home very early to avoid the traffic jams, and sleep in their cars until their office opens. Many people accept a long trip to work so that they can live in quiet bedroom communities away from the city, but another reason is \u2018 white flight \u2019. In the 1960s most cities began to desegregate their schools, so that there were no longer separate schools for white and black children. Many white families did not want to send their children to desegregated schools, so they moved to the suburbs, which have their own schools, and where, for various reasons, few black people live.Millions of people in Britain commute by car or train. Some spend two or three hours a day travelling, so that they and their families can live in suburbia or in the countryside. Cities are surrounded by commuter belts. Part of the commuter belt around London is called the stockbroker belt because it contains houses where rich business people live. Some places are dormitory towns, because people sleep there but take little part in local activities.Most commuters travel to and from work at the same time, causing the morning and evening rush hours, when buses and trains are crowded and there are traffic jams on the roads. Commuters on trains rarely talk to each other and spend their journey reading, sleeping or using their mobile phones. Increasing numbers of people now work at home some days of the week, linked to their offices by computer, a practice called telecommuting.Cities in both Britain and the US are trying to reduce the number of cars coming into town each day. Some companies encourage car pooling (called car sharing in Britain), an arrangement for people who live and work near each other to travel together. Some US cities have a public service that helps such people to contact each other, and traffic lanes are reserved for car-pool vehicles. But cars and petrol\/gas are cheap in the US, and many people prefer to drive alone because it gives them more freedom. Many cities have park-and-ride schemes, car parks on the edge of the city from which buses take drivers into the centre. In Britain in 2003 a scheme called congestion charging was introduced in London to make people who drive in the city centre pay a congestion charge.","5304":"a group of people together","5310":"to be similar to sb\/sth else, either better or worse","5315":"one of the separate sections that sth such as a piece of furniture or equipment has for keeping things in","5323":"of ideas, methods or things","5336":"a skill that you need in a particular job or for a particular task","5341":"the people who are competing against sb","5344":"of a person","5364":"the act or process of finishing sth; the state of being finished and complete","5371":"if sb has a complex about sth, they are worried about it in way that is not normal","5372":"the natural colour and condition of the skin on a person's face","5382":"to obey a rule, an order, etc","5383":"one of several parts of which sth is made","5394":"the act of composing sth","5399":"to make sth bad become even worse by causing further damage or problems","5401":"to mix sth together","5426":"to give all your attention to sth and not think about anything else","5427":"to bring sth together in one place","5435":"the amount of a substance in a liquid or in another substance","5454":"a public performance of music","5460":"the right to sell sth in a particular place; the place where you sell it, sometimes an area which is part of a larger building or store","5466":"the formal and final arrangement of sth official","5498":"to direct a group of people who are singing or playing music","5504":"a person whose job is to collect money from passengers on a bus or check their tickets","5513":"a meeting at which people have formal discussions","5535":"limits or borders","5537":"to make sb feel or believe sth even more strongly","5560":"unable to think clearly or to understand what is happening or what sb is saying","5569":"of a person","5574":"Being religious","5584":"the fact of stars, planets, etc. passing close together as seen from the earth","5587":"to join a computer to the Internet or a computer network","5589":"to arrive just before another one leaves so that passengers can change from one to the other","5618":"able to use your senses and mental powers to understand what is happening","5626":"an opinion that all members of a group agree with","5653":"the quality of always behaving in the same way or of having the same opinions, standard, etc; the quality of being consistent","5709":"a company that gives expert advice on a particular subject to other companies or organizations","5738":"the act of keeping another country's power within limits so that it does not become too powerful","5739":"belonging to the same time","5764":"forming part of, or typical of, any of the seven main land masses of the earth","5774":"something that is joined on to sth else and forms a part of it","5781":"existing in the same state without change or interruption","5785":"spreading in a line or over an area without any spaces","5807":"differences in colour or in light and dark, used in photographs and paintings to create a special effect","5813":"to be one of the causes of sth","5819":"an item that forms part of a book, magazine, broadcast, discussion, etc","5835":"to make sth, such as a machine or system, work in the way that you want it to","5857":"especially of weapons","5863":"the act or process of changing sth from one form, use or system to another","5864":"the process or experience of changing your religion or beliefs","5868":"to change an opinion, a habit, etc","5873":"Breaking the law","5874":"the act of finding sb guilty of a crime in court; the fact of having been found guilty","5883":"to prepare food by heating it, for example by boiling, baking or frying it","5886":"to invent sth, especially in order to trick sb","5948":"the most important or central beliefs, etc. of a person or group","5967":"a region at the south-west tip of England.

This is often not true. Many older people now study at college or university, sometimes on a part-time basis while having a job and looking after a family. Many students are highly motivatedand work very hard.In Britain reduced government support for higher educationmeans that students can no longer rely on having their expenses paid for them. Formerly, students received a grant towards their living expenses. Now most can only get a loan, which has to be paid back. From 1999 they have had to pay a fixed amount towards tuition fees and from 2006 universities will be able to increase the amount up to a maximum of \u00a33\u2009000 per year. In the US students already have to pay for tuition and room and board. Many get a financial aid package which may include grants, scholarshipsand loans. The fear of having large debts places considerable pressure on students and many take part-time jobs during the term and work full-time in the vacations.Many students in Britain go to a university away from their home town. They usually live in a hall of residence for their first year, and then move into a rented room in a private house or share a house with housemates. They may go back home during vacations, but after they graduatemost leave home for good. In the US too, many students attend colleges some distance from where their parents live. They may live on campus in one of the halls, or off campus in apartments and houses which they share with room-mates. Some students, especially at larger universities, join a  fraternity or  sorority, a social group usually with its own house near the campus. Fraternities and sororities often have names which are combinations of two or three letters of the Greek alphabet. Some people do not have a good opinion of them because they think that students who are members spend too much time having parties.In Britain the interests of students are represented by a student\u2019s union which liaiseswith the university on academic matters, arranges social events and provides advice to students. Individual unions are affiliated with (= linked to) the  NUS. The student union building is usually the centre of student life and has a bar and common room, and often a restaurant and shops. British universities have a wide range of societies, clubs and social activities including sports, drama and politics. One of the highlights (= main events) of the year is rag week, a week of parties and fund-raising activities in support of various charities.Especially in their first year, US students spend a lot of time on social activities. One of the most important celebrations, especially at universities which place a lot of emphasis on sports, is  homecoming. Many alumni (= former students) return to their alma mater (= college) for a weekend in the autumn to watch a football game. During homecoming weekend there are also parties and dances, and usually a parade.When social activities take up too much time, students skip lectures (= miss them) or cut class (AmE) and take incompletes (AmE), which means they have to finish their work after the vacation. In the US this has the effect of lowering their course grades, but most US universities expect this behaviour from students and do little to stop it. Students are thought to be old enough to make their own decisions about how hard they work and to accept the consequences. A few students drop out (AmE flunk out) but the majority try hard to get good grades and a good degree.","7900":"covered in dots","7925":"a port in Kent, south-east England, and the nearest English town to France.

By the early 1900s, when railways reached the height of their popularity, there were about 23\u2009000 miles\/37\u2009000 kilometres of railway track. Victorian engineers such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed bridges for the railway, and architects designed elaborate station buildings such as St Pancras in London.The railways played a vital role in Britain\u2019s industrial development during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Later, with the invention of the internal combustion engine (= the type of engine used in cars), road transport became more popular for both goods and passengers. In 1947 regional railway companies were nationalizedand became British Rail (later BR), but following the Beeching report in 1963 many lines (= routes) were closed in order to save money. In 1994 the government decided that BR should be returned to private ownership. Tracks and stations were made the responsibility of a company called Railtrack, while trains were once again operated by several companies on a regional basis. People have been encouraged to use trains and other forms of public transport to help reduce fuel consumption and pollution.The railway network connects all the major towns in Britain, and now, via the  Channel Tunnel, links Britain with France and Belgium. Railways are used for both short and long journeys, for commuting to work each day, and for transporting freight. In 2003 more than a billion journeys were made by rail in Britain and rail travel had increased by 36% in ten years. Some routes are now electrified and have high-speed trains. Others still rely on diesel-powered locomotives. Some trains are old, dirty and overcrowded. They also have a reputation for being late, and jokes are often made about the excuses given for delays. These have included \u2018leaves on the line\u2019 in autumn, and \u2018the wrong kind of snow\u2019. Tickets are quite expensive, although students and old people can get railcards which entitle them to cheaper fares.Following several major railway accidents and the failure of the Railtrack company in 2002 the government set up Network Rail to be responsible for the railway system used by the train operating companies, private companies which run the trains. These companies provide information about trains to the public through their organization, National Rail.Most Americans have never been on a train. This is sad because the railroads, as they are generally called in the US, were the means by which the Old West was settled. Passenger trains today mainly serve commuters around large cities. The only major long-distance railway business is done by freight trains (BrE also goods trains).The first US rail company was the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1828, but its cars (BrE carriages) were pulled by horses. Steam power was used by the 1830s, and the Pullman car was invented in 1856. The Civil War led to the rapid development of railroads, and the nation was connected from east to west in 1869 when the Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific joined their tracks in Utah. The 20th century brought more powerful locomotives and huge stations, like Grand Central in New York. The greatest period of US railroads began in the middle of the 19th century and lasted about 100 years. This time has been celebrated with popular songs like I\u2019ve Been Working on the Railroad, Freight Train Blues,  John Henry,  Chattanooga Choo Choo, Orange Blossom Special and  Casey Jones. Trains and railroad workers were also the subjects of many films and novels.After World War II car ownership greatly increased and people no longer used trains as a means of transport. Union Pacific, once known for its two-level \u2018dome lounge cars\u2019 from which passengers could see the scenery, stopped long-distance passenger services in 1971. Amtrak, a company controlled by the government, now runs the California Zephyr, the Texas Eagle and other trains but it is not very successful in attracting passengers.Some Americans are train buffs and take special steam locomotive trips. Americans also collect model trains, some of which, including the heavy Lionel sets from the 1940s, are now valuable. In Britain old and young alike visit railway museums at e.g. Didcot and York. Trainspotting (= recording the names and registration numbers of locomotives) used to be a popular hobby, especially for boys, but is less common now.","15841":"temporary accommodation","15843":"late Old English","15852":"the practical organization that is needed to make a complicated plan successful when a lot of people and equipment is involved","15878":"to turn your head so that you can see sth","15879":"to visit a place or building, walking around it to see what is there","15890":"to watch sth without becoming involved in it yourself","15893":"used to warn sb to be careful, especially when there is danger","15901":"to examine or read sth quickly","15909":"an act of trying to find sth\/sb","15911":"the way sb\/sth looks; the appearance of sb\/sth","15925":"not tightly packed together; not solid or hard","15935":"in a way that is not firm or tight","15942":"(in Britain) the title used by a lord","15950":"to have sth\/sb taken away from you as a result of an accident, getting old, dying, etc","15951":"to have sth taken away by sb\/sth","15964":"a person who is regularly unsuccessful, especially when you have a low opinion of them","15965":"a person who suffers because of a particular action, decision, etc","15969":"the disadvantage that is caused when sb leaves or when a useful or valuable object is taken away; a person who causes a disadvantage by leaving","15973":"that cannot be obtained; that cannot be found or created again","15975":"unable to understand sth because it is too complicated","15978":"the whole number or amount of people or things","15992":"one of a set of narrow strips of wood, plastic, etc. in a door or a window that are designed to let air and some light in, but to keep out strong light or rain; a door or a window that has these strips across it","15995":"the strong feeling of enjoyment that sth gives you","16007":"feeling or showing love and affection for sb\/sth","16013":"having a reduced amount or not enough of sth","16023":"not high; not loudly","16026":"an area of low pressure in the atmosphere","16030":"Loyalists are also sometimes known as Unionists.

The traditional full English breakfast served in many British hotels may include fruit juice, cereal, bacon and eggs, often with sausages and tomatoes, toastand marmalade, and tea or coffee. Few people have time to prepare a cooked breakfast at home and most have only cereal and\/or toast with tea or coffee. Others buy coffee and a pastry on their way to work.The traditional American breakfast includes eggs, some kind of meat and toast. Eggs may be fried, \u2018over easy\u2019, \u2018over hard\u2019 or \u2018sunny side up\u2019, or boiled, poached or in an omelette (= beaten together and fried). The meat may be bacon or sausage. People who do not have time for a large meal have toast or cereal and coffee. It is common for Americans to eat breakfast in a restaurant. On Saturday and Sunday many people eat brunch late in the morning. This consists of both breakfast and lunch dishes, including pancakes and waffles (= types of cooked batter) that are eaten with butter and maple syrup. Lunch, which is eaten any time after midday, is the main meal of the day for some British people, though people out at work may have only sandwiches. Some people also refer to the midday meal as dinner. Most workers are allowed about an hour off work for it, called the lunch hour, and many also go shopping. Many schools offer a cooked lunch (school lunch or school dinner), though some students take a packed lunch of sandwiches, fruit, etc. Sunday lunch is special and is, for many families, the biggest meal of the week, consisting traditionally of roast meat and vegetables and a sweet course. In the US lunch is usually a quick meal, eaten around midday. Many workers have a half-hour break for lunch, and buy a sandwich from near their place of work. Business people may sometimes eat a larger lunch and use the time to discuss business.The main meal of the day for most people is the evening meal, called supper, tea or dinner. It is usually a cooked meal with meat or fish or a salad, followed by a sweet course. In Britain younger children may have tea when they get home from school. Tea, meaning a main meal for adults, is the word used in some parts of Britain especially when the evening meal is eaten early. Dinner sounds more formal than supper, and guests generally receive invitations to \u2018dinner\u2019 rather than to \u2018supper\u2019. In the US the evening meal is called dinner and is usually eaten around 6 or 6.30 p.m. In many families, both in Britain and in the US, family members eat at different times and rarely sit down at the table together.Many people also eat snacks between meals. Most have tea or coffee at mid-morning, often called coffee time or the coffee break. In Britain in the past this was sometimes also called elevenses. In the afternoon many British people have a tea break. Some hotels serve afternoon tea which consists of tea or coffee and a choice of sandwiches and cakes. When on holiday\/vacation people sometimes have a  cream tea of scones, jam and cream. In addition many people eat chocolate bars, biscuits (AmE cookies) or crisps (AmE chips). Some British people have a snack, sometimes called supper, consisting of a milk drink and a biscuit before they go to bed. In the US children often have milk and cookies after school.","16072":"a wild animal of the cat family, with spots on its fur and a very short tail","16081":"a group of people that control an organization or part of an organization","16098":"very, extremely","16101":"crazy or stupid behaviour that could be dangerous","16117":"an official who acts as a judge in the lowest courts of law","16123":"behaving like a magnet\u2009(1)","16126":"extremely attractive and impressive; deserving praise","16134":"a reddish-brown colour","16147":"the main area of land of a country, not including any islands near to it","16184":"to elect or choose sb as sth","16206":"to legally give sth to sb","16209":"to invent a story, etc, especially in order to trick or entertain sb","16216":"to end a disagreement with sb and become friends again","16221":"a disease that causes fever and shivering (= shaking of the body) caused by the bite of some types of mosquito","16222":"a country in southern central Africa, between Tanzania, Zambia and Mozambique.

The distance between Boston and San Francisco, for instance, is more than 3\u2009000 miles\/ 4\u2009827 kilometres. The US began to build the  interstate highwaysystem in 1956. By 2004 it had more than 42\u2009000 miles\/(67\u2009578 kilometres of road. The interstate system greatly helped the country\u2019s economy, but it also hurt the economies of many small towns not on an interstate. Interstates running north to south have odd numbers and those going from east to west have even numbers. They often have only two or three lanes in each direction through the countryside but may have eight or more each way through cities. The New Jersey Turnpike, for instance, has 14 lanes each way near New York City.Other major roads in the US are called superhighways, freeways, expressways, thruways or parkways. There are also many county and local roads, called variously arterial roads, feeder roads or farm roads. Some states have tollways or turnpikes, on which drivers must pay a toll.Interstate highways are marked with red and blue signs showing an \u2018I\u2019 followed by the road\u2019s number. Other US highways have red, white and blue signs. Some state roads, like those in Louisiana and Texas, have signs in the shape of the state. Since 1995 states have been able to set their own speed limits. This is usually 65 or 70 mph\/105 or 112 kph on interstate roads but lower on other main roads.In Britain the fastest and most direct routes between major cities are by motorways, which usually have three lanes of traffic in each direction and a speed limit of 70 mph\/112 kph. Each motorway is identified by the letter \u2018M\u2019 and a number. Main roads other than motorways are called A-roads and are numbered A6, A34, etc. Some A-roads are dual carriageways with two or more lanes each way. Most A-roads now follow a bypass round towns. Narrower roads which have only one lane in each direction are called B-roads. Most roads have white lines and Catseyes \u2122 (= objects sunk into the ground that reflect a car\u2019s lights) down the middle. Only a very few roads have tolls but Britain\u2019s first toll motorway, the M6 Toll opened in 2003 as an alternative to the heavily used M6 near Birmingham. Narrow country roads below B-road standard may be known locally by the name of the place they go to, e.g. Orston Lane.In Britain the  Highway Code describes the many signs placed beside roads. Red circular signs give instructions that must by law be obeyed. These include \u2018no overtaking\u2019 signs and signs about speed limits. Red triangular signs give warnings about possible dangers ahead, e.g. slippery roads. Direction signs to major towns are blue on motorways and green on other roads; signs to smaller places are white. Old-fashioned signposts can still be seen in some country areas.In the US red road signs, like \u2018Stop\u2019, must be obeyed. Signs that indicate danger, as in areas where rocks might fall, have a yellow diamond shape. Arrows indicating bends in the road are shown in green circles on white signs. Many other US road signs are now similar to those in Europe.In Britain there is pressure from both business and private road users for more and better roads, despite the damage to the environment and increase in pollution that this may cause. People who are against the building of new roads regularly challenge proposed routes of new motorways or bypasses. If they fail, environmentalistsset up protest camps along the route of the new road. Recently, experts too have cast doubt on the wisdom of building more roads, saying it simply encourages greater use of cars. In the US there are few protests against road-building. People generally want more roads to make their journeys faster and more convenient.","17271":"a horse that you ride on","17272":"something that an object stands on or is attached to for support","17274":"a very large amount or number of sth","17276":"very large in size or amount; like a mountain","17293":"to move your lips as if you were saying sth, but without making a sound","17300":"to take action; to do sth","17311":"especially of a vehicle","17347":"to make sth muddy","17351":"a person's face","17372":"a body of a human or an animal that has been mummified","17376":"military weapons, ammunition and equipment","17407":"with musical skill","17409":"a person who plays a musical instrument or writes music, especially as a job","17422":"a change in the form or structure of sth","17446":"a country in South East Asia","17454":"difficult to understand or explain; strange","17462":"a religious belief that cannot be explained or proved in a scientific way","17469":"that does not exist or is not true","17472":"ideas that many people think are true but that do not exist or are false","17490":"of emotions, attitudes, etc.","17503":"to say the name of sb\/sth","17509":"an offensive word for a homosexual man, or a man who behaves in a way that is thought to be typical of women","17513":"the back of the neck","17515":"the act or process of telling a story, especially in a novel, a film\/movie or a play","17536":"unkind; unpleasant","17542":"a country considered as a group of people with the same language, culture and history, who live in a particular area under one government","17556":"that you have naturally without having to learn it","17561":"NATO was originally formed by 12 countries in 1949 to defend Europe and North America against what was seen as the threat of Soviet attack after the Second World War.

After the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s, and the joining of East and West Germany in 1990, it was suggested that NATO should become a political organization rather than a military one. In 1995 NATO started a major new approach called Partnership for Peace, to make political and military links stronger between NATO and the central and eastern European countries.

Most vocational training takes place not in universities but in  colleges of further education and in colleges specializing in art, accountancy, etc. Some secondary schools now also offer an introduction to vocational training.  NVQs (National Vocational Qualifications) are qualifications that can be obtained by people already working in a particular industry. Colleges of further education run courses to provide a theoretical background. NVQs are awarded on the basis of practical work, spoken and written tests, and coursework. There are five levels, from Foundation to Management. In schools and colleges people can combine study with practical training for particular kinds of employment by doing vocational GCSEs or choosing a 2-year Diploma course for students aged 14\u201319 at three levels, Foundation, Higher and Advanced. There are also BTEC courses in schools, colleges and universities.In the US there are no national qualifications like NVQs, though some professional organizations decide on their own qualifications and some of these have become widely accepted. Much vocational training is done by private institutions which are sometimes called proprietary schools. Although many of these are good, in general they have a bad reputation. This is partly because there are no controls over who can operate such a school. Some proprietary schools try to get as many students as possible, including some who will probably not be able to complete their training.Most US secondary schools programmes do not provide a choice between an academic and a practical track (= programme of study), but most do give students an opportunity to take some practical or vocational classes. Large school districts may have magnet schools, schools that attract students with certain interests, and some of these may have a larger choice of vocational courses.","30010":"of a contract, an agreement etc.","30015":"a mountain with a large opening at the top through which gases and lava (= hot liquid rock) are forced out into the air, or have been in the past","30026":"willingly; without being forced","30039":"a formal choice that you make in an election or at a meeting in order to choose sb or decide sth","30043":"the right to vote, especially in political elections","30045":"to choose sb\/sth for a position or an award by voting","30050":"to dismiss sb from a position by voting","30057":"a person who goes on a long journey, especially by ship to unknown parts of the world","30058":" vice-president","30064":"west; western","30080":"used to say that you are about to tell sb sth that is surprising or amusing","30108":"to leave a difficult situation or relationship, etc. instead of staying and trying to deal with it","30122":"a way or style of walking; the act or speed of walking rather than running","30125":"the activity of going for walks in the countryside for exercise or pleasure","30146":"of a person's mind or thoughts","30148":"of a road or river","30154":"to lack sth","30168":"a fight or an effort over a long period of time to get rid of or stop sth unpleasant","30170":"(in Britain), a title given to the head of some colleges and institutions","30185":"used to say that sb has almost guessed the answer to sth or that they have almost found sb\/sth that has been hidden","30190":"a piece of clothing, a device, etc. that warms sb\/sth","30198":"to advise sb not to do sth or to stop doing sth","30210":"(especially in the past) a person who fights in a battle or war","30224":"of a dirty mark","30253":"used water that contains waste substances from homes, factories and farms","30275":"of a river, etc.","30277":"a place where a stream or river falls from a high place, for example over a cliff or rock","30286":"a town in Hertfordshire, north of London, that is considered to mark the northern limit of the area of London and SE England.
