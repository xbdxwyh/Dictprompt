Many wear casual clothes most of the time, not just when they are at home or on holiday. Men and women wear  jeans or  cords (=  corduroy trousers) with a shirt or T-shirt and a sweater to go shopping, meet friends, go to a pub or bar, or take their children out. Older people are more likely to dress more smartly, with women wearing a dress or skirt and blouse, and men a shirt, jacket and trousers, when they go out. In summer younger people may wear shorts (= short trousers\/pants), but some people think they are only appropriate on the beach.Most people dress up (= put on smart clothes) to go to a party or club. Some restaurants will not let in people who are wearing jeans. Most people do not now dress up to go to the theatre. Young people are most interested in following fashion and regularly buy new clothes.Men wear lounge suits, and women wear suits or dresses, for formal occasions like funerals or interviews for jobs. Some wear suits or smart clothes every day because their employer expects it or because they think it makes them look more professional. In London many people who work in the City wear pinstripe suits made of dark cloth with narrow grey vertical lines. Most people prefer casual, comfortable clothes for work but some companies do not like people wearing jeans. Employees in banks and shops often have uniforms.For formal occasions during the day, such as a wedding, men may wear morning dress. This includes a jacket with long \u2018tails\u2019 at the back, dark grey trousers and a grey top hat. Women wear a smart dress and often a hat. For very formal events in the evening, men may wear evening dress, also called white tie, which consists of a black tailcoat, black trousers, a white waistcoat, white shirt and white bow tie. Women usually wear a long evening dress or ball gown. Usually for formal evening events men wear black tie\/tuxedo, consisting of a black dinner jacket, black trousers and a black bow tie.","29343":"unpleasant to look at","16181":"to decide, guess, etc. sth","9424":"used to refer to a person of the type mentioned","28377":"difficult to manage with because there is not enough","4596":"accepted or deserving to be accepted as one of the best or most important of its kind","7793":"appearing not to be affected by sth; separate from sth","6790":"a person's female child","28265":"to send light or shade onto sth","4282":"to look at or examine a person or thing that seems interesting or attractive","21834":"to tell sb that sth is good or useful, or that sb would be suitable for a particular job, etc","15002":"to describe sb\/sth in a particular way, especially unfairly","23579":"a large number of fish or other sea animals, swimming together","30641":"used in questions to ask who sth belongs to","13660":"happening or done without delay","22742":"if a sound rises, it become louder and higher","21085":"something that you have bought","25944":"an area of land or water","2846":"(= sold in metal containers for use in heating and cooking)","20895":"the system of paying criminals so that they will not attack your business or property","1593":"very bad or unpleasant","18267":"used for emphasis instead of a or an","1442":"an act of trying to do sth, especially sth difficult, often with no success","425":"to officially tell sb sth","5462":"to come to an end; to bring sth to an end","16170":"a student studying a particular subject as the main part of their course","9921":"to have an argument with sb about sth","16855":"a unit for measuring distance equal to 1\u2009609 metres or 1\u2009760 yards","22404":"a particular aspect or detail of sth","27791":"connected with the practical use of machinery, methods, etc. in science and industry","10695":"a student in the form mentioned at school","12587":"used when saying sth that you would prefer not to have to say, or when politely asking to do sth","18621":"a loose piece of clothing like a shirt and trousers\/pants in one piece, made of heavy cloth and usually worn over other clothing by workers doing dirty work","20547":"main; most important; basic","8593":"very simple and easy","19859":"to use things in different ways to produce an interesting or humorous effect, or to see what effect they have","30343":"people in general","8931":"the fact of a liquid, gas, etc. coming out of a pipe or container by accident; the amount that comes out","7942":"to force sb\/sth down to the ground","20312":"doing an activity or training regularly so that you can improve your skill; the time you spend doing this","27583":"to absorb sth into the body, for example by breathing or swallowing","8832":"to consider or allow yourself to think about an idea, a hope, a feeling, etc","10897":"usually of food","24189":"the state of becoming firm or solid","19589":"a large impressive building","6093":"Britain is divided into small administrative regions, many of which are called counties. Three regions, the counties of Essex and Kent and the region of Sussex (which includes the counties of East and West Sussex), have the same names and cover almost the same areas as three of the former Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. Other counties, e.g. Dorset, are probably based on areas where particular tribes once lived.Counties were previously called shires. The original shires were the counties of the English Midlands and the word became part of their name, e.g. Northamptonshire. Administrative and legal affairs were dealt with by shire courts presided over by shire-reeves, later called sheriffs. Many shires were divided into smaller districts called hundreds. The large former county of Yorkshire was until 1974 divided into ridings, North Riding, East Riding and West Riding, named after the three divisions of the 9th century Viking kingdom of York.The families of people who own land in the shire counties, are sometimes described as county, as in a county family and She\u2019s very county, or are said to belong to the county set. Such people have a high social status and are thought to have a way of life that is typical of the upper class.Counties were for a long time the basis for  local government. Since 1972 there have been many changes to their boundaries and names, and to the structure of local government. Most recently,  unitary authorities have been created throughout Wales and in many places in England, and a similar system of  council areas introduced in Scotland. The main difference is that counties have two tiers (= levels) of local government, at county and at district level, and unitary authorities and council areas have only one level. Some towns that were previously part of counties, e.g. Southampton, are now separate unitary authorities. Many people are confused by all the changes and continue to use the old county names. People do not like to have changes forced upon them, and in 1974 local people were unhappy when the small county of Rutland was abolishedand became part of Leicestershire. In 1996, when they had the opportunity to change, the people of Rutland chose to have their own separate unitary authority.In the US most states are divided into counties, which are the largest units of local government. There are over 3\u2009000 counties in the US; Delaware has just three, while Texas has 254. Connecticut and Rhode Island have none. In Louisiana, similar units of local government are called parishes, and in Alaska they are called boroughs. In some urban areas, such as Philadelphia and Boston, the city takes up almost the entire county.","5124":"used in orders to tell sb to hurry or to try harder","7528":"not as good, successful, etc. as you had hoped;

This is often not true. Many older people now study at college or university, sometimes on a part-time basis while having a job and looking after a family. Many students are highly motivatedand work very hard.In Britain reduced government support for higher educationmeans that students can no longer rely on having their expenses paid for them. Formerly, students received a grant towards their living expenses. Now most can only get a loan, which has to be paid back. From 1999 they have had to pay a fixed amount towards tuition fees and from 2006 universities will be able to increase the amount up to a maximum of \u00a33\u2009000 per year. In the US students already have to pay for tuition and room and board. Many get a financial aid package which may include grants, scholarshipsand loans. The fear of having large debts places considerable pressure on students and many take part-time jobs during the term and work full-time in the vacations.Many students in Britain go to a university away from their home town. They usually live in a hall of residence for their first year, and then move into a rented room in a private house or share a house with housemates. They may go back home during vacations, but after they graduatemost leave home for good. In the US too, many students attend colleges some distance from where their parents live. They may live on campus in one of the halls, or off campus in apartments and houses which they share with room-mates. Some students, especially at larger universities, join a  fraternity or  sorority, a social group usually with its own house near the campus. Fraternities and sororities often have names which are combinations of two or three letters of the Greek alphabet. Some people do not have a good opinion of them because they think that students who are members spend too much time having parties.In Britain the interests of students are represented by a student\u2019s union which liaiseswith the university on academic matters, arranges social events and provides advice to students. Individual unions are affiliated with (= linked to) the  NUS. The student union building is usually the centre of student life and has a bar and common room, and often a restaurant and shops. British universities have a wide range of societies, clubs and social activities including sports, drama and politics. One of the highlights (= main events) of the year is rag week, a week of parties and fund-raising activities in support of various charities.Especially in their first year, US students spend a lot of time on social activities. One of the most important celebrations, especially at universities which place a lot of emphasis on sports, is  homecoming. Many alumni (= former students) return to their alma mater (= college) for a weekend in the autumn to watch a football game. During homecoming weekend there are also parties and dances, and usually a parade.When social activities take up too much time, students skip lectures (= miss them) or cut class (AmE) and take incompletes (AmE), which means they have to finish their work after the vacation. In the US this has the effect of lowering their course grades, but most US universities expect this behaviour from students and do little to stop it. Students are thought to be old enough to make their own decisions about how hard they work and to accept the consequences. A few students drop out (AmE flunk out) but the majority try hard to get good grades and a good degree.","15308":"to not do sth or deal with sth immediately","28121":"of a person or part of the body","14785":"to make sth stay out of sth","13448":"a strong desire for sth","3832":"to be pregnant with sb","6860":"a person whose business is buying and selling a particular product","30793":"a thing that you want to have or to happen","16112":"having a special quality that makes sth seem wonderful","20167":"a person or organization's level of importance when compared with others","23565":"a clever person who works hard at school","15217":"to put sth on one side and not use it or think about it","4714":"a person whose job is to keep the records or accounts in an office, shop\/store etc","24930":"a title that is used before the first name of a man who has received one of the highest British honours (= a knight ), or before the first name of a baronet","2174":"to feel that you can trust sb and\/or that they will be successful","23816":"a separate group within a larger group of people","8003":"plays considered as a form of literature","30460":"to be pleased to receive or accept sth","13014":"to bring a bat, etc. against a ball and push it away with force","20271":"a very fine, soft, dry substance that you can put on your face to make it look smooth and dry","14965":"to have information in your mind as a result of experience or because you have learned or been told it","11828":"to go through or over an area on a horse, bicycle, etc","19767":"a large round object in space that moves around a star (such as the sun) and receives light from it","6581":"a piece of thick, heavy cloth that hangs in front of the stage in the theatre","15429":"to stop rising or falling and remain horizontal","7769":"to separate into two parts that lead in different directions","10249":"to send information quickly by radio, computer, etc","8153":"a journey in a car or other vehicle","30451":"to give different values to things to show how important you think each of them is compared with the others","15870":"to try to find sb\/sth","2424":"a wound made by an animal or insect","4050":"slight;

It is played by boys in most schools. Most towns have an amateur football teamwhich plays in a minor league. Football is also the most popular spectator sport in Britain. Many people go to see their favourite professional team playing at home, and some go to away matches. Many more people watch football on television.The rules of football are relatively simple: two teams of 11 players try to get a round ball into the opposing team\u2019s goal and to prevent their opponents from scoring. The ball may be kicked or headed, but never handled, except by the goalkeepers. The Football Association was founded in 1863 to decide the rules of football and the resulting game became known formally as association football. It is sometimes also called soccer. Many of today\u2019s leading clubs were established shortly afterwards.Most professional clubs represent large cities, or parts of London. They include Everton, Liverpool, Manchester United, Arsenal, Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. The most famous Scottish clubs include Rangers and Celtic. In 1992 football was reorganized so that the best 20 teams in England and Wales play in the  Premiership, while 70 other teams play in three divisions, run by the Football League. There is a Scottish Premier League and three divisions run by the Scottish Football League. At the end of each season, the top few teams in each division are promoted and the bottom teams are relegated. As well as the Premiership, the main competitions are the FA Cup and the League Cup. A few of the most successful sides have won the Double, the Premiership and the FA cup in the same year. The biggest clubs are now run as major businesses, and top players earn large salaries. They are frequently transferred between clubs for millions of pounds. Many foreign stars also now play for British teams.England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland all have their own national sides. England won the World Cup in 1966, when its stars included Bobby Charlton, Bobby Moore and Geoff Hurst.An increase in football hooliganism in the 1970s and 1980s frightened many people away from football matches. English fans got a bad reputation in Europe and football violence became known as \u2018the English disease\u2019. Disasters such as that at Hillsborough, in which many people died, also discouraged people from going to matches. Formerly, football grounds had terraces, where supporters stood packed close together, and stands containing rows of seats which were more expensive. These grounds have now almost all been replaced by all-seater stadiums, but people complain about the rising cost of tickets. Many clubs have their own fanzine (= a magazine about the club written and published by the fans). Some supporters also buy a copy of their team\u2019s strip (= shorts and shirt in team colours).This type of football is known in the US as soccer to distinguish it from the American game. Enthusiasm increased after 1994 when the World Cup was played for the first time in the US. In 1999 the US won the Women\u2019s World Cup. In 1996 Major League Soccer (MLS) was established, and teams compete for the MLS Cup. Students in colleges and universities also play soccer in three NCAA divisions. The nation\u2019s oldest tournamentis the US Open Cup. About 18 million American children now play regularly, and the expression soccer mom (= a mother who spends a lot of time taking her children to sporting activities) has entered the language.","5082":"to return to sb's memory","11879":"valid for sth","22913":"having the number of rooms mentioned","5133":"if a photograph comes out, it is a clear picture when it is developed and printed","839":"to move or place sth so that it is not straight or not directly facing sb\/sth","1460":"used for asking people to listen to sth that is being announced","12577":"a position or role, especially an official or professional role, when you have more than one such role","15143":"recently;

The world\u2019s major film companies have studios in Hollywood and many famous film\/movie stars live in its fashionable and expensive Beverly Hills district. But Hollywood is also  Tinseltown, where money can buy an expensive lifestyle but the pressure to succeed can ruin lives, as in the case of Marilyn Monroe and River Phoenix. Both the British and Americans have mixed feelings about Hollywood: they are fascinated by the excitement of the film world and by the lives of the stars, but also see Hollywood as a symbol of trashy, commercial culture.Hollywood is now surrounded by Los Angeles. In 1908, when film companies began moving west from New York, it was a small, unknown community. The companies were attracted to California by its fine weather, which allowed them to film outside for most of the year, but they also wanted to avoid having to pay money to a group of studios led by Thomas Edison which were trying to establish a monopoly. Most of the companies were run by people from Jewish families who had come to America from Europe. By the 1920s, companies such as Universal and United Artists had set up studios around Hollywood. During this period Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks1, and John Barrymore became famous in silent films (= films without sound). Mack Sennett, a Canadian, began making comedy films, including those featuring the Keystone Kops, in which Charlie Chaplin and \u201aFatty\u2019 Arbuckle became stars. D W Griffith directed expensive \u201aepic\u2019 films like The Birth of a Nation, and William S Hart made westerns popular. Hollywood also created its first sex symbol, Theda Bara (1890\u20131955).The 1920s saw big changes. The first film in Technicolor was produced in 1922. Warner Brothers was formed in 1923 and four years later produced Hollywood\u2019s first talkie (= film with spoken words), The Jazz Singer. Huge numbers of Americans were now attracted to the movies. Stars like Pickford and Chaplin reached the height of their fame, and new stars were discovered, such as Rudolph Valentino, Laurel and Hardy and Buster Keaton.The 1930s and 1940s were Hollywood\u2019s \u201aGolden Age\u2019 and films became popular around the world. Hollywood even made successes out of America\u2019s worst times: Prohibition led to the gangster films of Edward G Robinson and James Cagney, and the Great Depression to films like The Grapes of Wrath. World War II featured in successful films like  Casablanca. The great Hollywood studios, MGM, Warner Brothers, 20th Century Fox, Paramount Pictures and Columbia Pictures, controlled the careers of actors. Famous directors of the time included Orson Welles and John Ford and screen stars included Clark Gable, John Wayne, Katharine Hepburn, Errol Flynn, Henry Fonda, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Bette Davis, Gregory Peck, Kirk Douglas and Robert Mitchum.New words were invented to keep up with Hollywood\u2019s development: cliffhanger, tear jerker, spine-chiller and western describe types of film. Villains became baddies or bad guys. As equipment became more sophisticated more people were needed to manage it. New jobs, still seen on lists of film credits today, included gaffer (= chief electrician) and best boy, his chief assistant.In the 1950s large numbers of people abandoned the movies in order to watch television. The film industry needed something new to attract them back. This led to the development of Cinerama and  3-D films, which gave the audience the feeling of being part of the action. These proved too expensive but the wide screen of CinemaScope soon became standard throughout the world. The stars of the 1950s, including Marilyn Monroe, Rock Hudson, James Dean and Steve McQueen, also kept the film industry alive.In the 1960s many companies began making films in other countries where costs were lower, and people said Hollywood would never again be the centre of the film industry. But the skills, equipment and money were still there, and Hollywood became important again in the 1980s. The old studios were bought by new media companies: 20th Century Fox was bought by Rupert Murdoch, and Columbia by the Sony Corporation. New energy came from independent directors and producers like Steven Spielberg, Robert Redford and Martin Scorsese. Rising stars included Meryl Streep, Harrison Ford, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Kevin Costner and Tom Hanks.Now, more than ever, Hollywood leads the world\u2019s film industry, producing the most expensive and successful films ever made, such as Jurassic Park (1993),  Forrest Gump, Independence Day (1996),  Titanic, Gladiator (2000) and Troy (2004). Companies like MGM own their own movie theaters in the US and elsewhere. Studios make extra profits from selling films to television companies and from selling videos and DVDs. The  Oscars, presented by Hollywood\u2019s  Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, are the most valued prizes in the industry.","10871":"when it freezes, the weather is at or below 0\u00b0 Celsius","11055":"money that is available to be spent","3726":"involving punishment by death","19294":"the ability to understand the true nature of sth","4658":"obvious and leaving no doubt at all","19349":"the act of allowing sb to do sth, especially when this is done by sb in a position of authority","8291":"to get rid of sth you do not want, especially in a place which is not suitable","3976":"to finally do what sb wants after you have been strongly opposing them","29167":"to adjust the controls on a radio or television so that you can receive a particular programme or channel","10182":"to punish sb who has harmed you and stop them doing you any more harm","3821":"if a person, an insect, etc. carries a disease, they are infected with it and might spread it to others although they might not become sick themselves","10258":"the sudden appearance for a short time of sth bright","23372":"a small amount or example of sth that can be looked at or tried to see what it is like","16757":"to make sth dirty or untidy","20165":"the situation that sb is in, especially when it affects what they can and cannot do","12543":"damage or injury that is caused by a person or an event","25571":"sensible; that you can rely on and that will probably give good results","11421":"to leave work with permission","25562":"the idea or impression that you get of sb\/sth from what sb says or what you read","29757":"having many different features","8658":"connected with people's feelings (= with the emotions)","2447":"evil or immoral","18596":"used to say that sth is very unlikely","13334":"not very good in quality","24490":"to move suddenly or quickly in one direction; to make sb\/sth move in this way","21196":"to make sb lose interest in or enthusiasm for sth\/sb","16417":"connected with fighting or war","12753":"in some religions","9237":"a hope that sth good will happen","8119":"a social occasion where you have alcoholic drinks","12471":"to wait for sth to happen","23892":"to ask sb for sth","10209":"a bright red or orange colour","11733":"to become ill\/sick with sth","26542":"to put sth somewhere and keep it there to use later","30352":"a weak liquid contains a lot of water","26541":"a place where goods of a particular kind are kept","1067":"the fourth month of the year, between March and May","15901":"to examine or read sth quickly","24834":"a type of fine smooth cloth made from silk thread","27133":"a person who supports a political party, an idea, etc","7682":"a difference or lack of a connection between two things","30915":"to find the answer to sth","5956":"a region or an area of a place (sometimes used for one that is far away or difficult to reach)","27695":"a large container for holding liquid or gas","15566":"to become or to make sth become bright with light or colour","11253":"happy and full of fun","19247":"a disadvantage suffered as a result of sth","4159":"all the priests of a cathedral or members of a religious community","16615":"a written suggestion, especially one for a new law made by the lawmakers of a state","1632":"used to describe furniture that has the type of back mentioned","8906":"equal in value, amount, meaning, importance, etc","6078":"an act of counting to find the total number of sth; the total number that you find","8151":"to continue driving","8727":"a person's death.

Most people have to take out a mortgage, a type of loan. In Britain people usually get a mortgage from a bank or a  building society; in the US they get one from a bank or a  savings and loan association. People usually put down a deposit (= pay a percentage of the price of the property) and borrow the rest, although some lenders will lend up to 100% of the amount needed. Mortgages are paid back in monthly payments over a period ranging from 15 to 30 years. The person borrowing the money has to pay interest on the loan, so that the final amount paid is considerably more than the amount of the loan itself. The security for the loan is the house itself. If a borrower fails to keep up payments, the house may be repossessed by the lender and sold so that they can get their money back.There are different types of mortgages. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the amount of interest remains at a particular level and the monthly payments do not change. This type of mortgage is more popular in the US than Britain, where variable-rate mortgages (AmE usually adjustable-rate mortgages) are more common. With a variable-rate mortgage, the rate of interest can increase or decrease depending on the state of the economy. Another type of mortgage in Britain is the endowment mortgage: borrowers pay interest on the loan to the bank or building society and a fixed sum towards an endowment policy, a type of insurance policy which should pay a sum of money that will be used to repay the loan. Many people with endowment mortgages have suffered because the growth of the policy was not enough to repay the loan and they are no longer sold.For many people, paying back a mortgage is their greatest financial burden. People talk of being \u2018mortgaged up to the hilt\u2019, meaning that their mortgage payments leave them with little money for anything else. It is possible to take out a second mortgage on a house. Another practice, called remortgaging (AmE refinancing) involves changing an existing mortgage to a different type offered by the lender or replacing it with a mortgage from another lender, usually in order to obtain a lower rate of interest.House prices sometimes rise very fast and then fall again. Some people who buy a house when prices are high can become victims of negative equity. Equity means the part of the value of a house that the buyer owns, and negative equity means a situation in which the value of a house falls below the amount borrowed as a mortgage. This makes it impossible to sell the house without being left with debt.","10876":"to stop a film\/movie or video in order to look at a particular picture","14895":"the male ruler of an independent state that has a royal family","25151":"a small piece of film held in a frame that can be shown on a screen when you shine a light through it","12477":"to attach things that you have washed to a piece of thin rope or wire, etc. outside so that they can dry;

Marriage is the state of being married, though the word can also mean the wedding ceremony.Before getting married a couple get engaged. It is traditional for the man to propose (= ask his girlfriend to marry him) and, if she accepts, to give his new fianc\u00e9e an engagement ring, which she wears on the third finger of her left hand. Today many couples decide together to get married.The couple then set a date and decide who will perform the marriage ceremony and where it will be held. In the US judges and religious leaders can perform weddings. Religious weddings are often held in a church or chapel, but the ceremony can take place anywhere and couples often choose somewhere that is special to them. In Britain many couples still prefer to be married in church, even if they are not religious. Others choose a civil ceremony conducted by a registrar at a registry office, or, since 1994 when the law was changed, at one of the many hotels and historic buildings which are licensed for weddings.Traditionally, the family of the bride (= the woman who is to be married) paid for the wedding, but today the couple usually pay part of the cost. Many people choose a traditional wedding with a hundred or more guests. Before the wedding, the couple send out printed invitations and guests buy a gift for them, usually something for their home. In the US couples register at a store by leaving there a list of presents they would like. Guests go to the store to look at the list and buy a present. In Britain couples send a wedding list to guests or, as in America, open a bride\u2019s book in a large store.Before a wedding can take place in a church it must be announced there on three occasions. This is called the reading of the banns. Some religious groups refuse to allow a couple to marry in church if either of them has been divorced, but they may agree to bless the marriage after a civil ceremony.Before the wedding the bride and bride groom or groom (= her future husband) often go to separate parties given for them by friends. At the groom\u2019s stag party guests drink alcohol and joke about how the groom is going to lose his freedom. For the bride there is a hen party, called in the US a bachelorette party. Sometimes these parties take the form of a weekend trip to a foreign city.At the wedding the groom\u2019s closest male friend acts as the best man and stands next to him during the ceremony. Other friends act as ushers and show guests where to sit. The bride\u2019s closest woman friend is chief bridesmaid (AmE maid of honour), or matron of honour if she is married, and other friends are bridesmaids. Children are bridesmaids if they are girls or pages if they are boys.Many women choose to have a white wedding, and wear a long white wedding dress, with a veil (= a piece of thin white material) covering the face. The bride\u2019s wedding clothes should include \u2018something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\u2019, to bring luck. The bridesmaids wear matching dresses specially made for the occasion and, like the bride, carry bouquets of flowers. The bridegroom, the best man and other men may wear morning dress (= a long-tailed jacket, dark trousers and a top hat) or, in the US, a tuxedo (= a black suit with a white shirt). Women guests dress smartly and often wear hats. Men often hire their clothes for a wedding but women often use a wedding as an opportunity to buy something new.The bride traditionally arrives at the church a few minutes late and enters with her father who will give her away to her husband. The bride and groom exchange vows (= promise to stay together and support each other). The groom places a wedding ring on the third finger of the bride\u2019s left hand, and sometimes the bride gives him a ring too. The couple are then declared man and wife. They sign the register (= the official record of marriages) and as they leave the church guests throw rice or confetti (= small pieces of coloured paper in lucky shapes, such as horseshoes and bells) over them.The \u2018 happy couple \u2019 and their guests then go to the wedding reception at the bride\u2019s home, a hotel or the place where the ceremony took place if it was not a church or registry office. There are often speeches by the best man, the bride\u2019s father and the bridegroom. The bride and groom together cut a wedding cake, which usually has several tiers (= layers), each covered with white icing (AmE frosting), with figures of a bride and groom on the top one. Before the newly-weds leave for their honeymoon (= a holiday to celebrate their marriage) the bride throws her bouquet in the air: there is a belief that the woman who catches it will soon be married herself. The car the couple leave in has usually been decorated by their friends with the words \u2018 just married \u2019 and with old tin cans or shoes tied to the back.","24408":"a large moving mass of fire or water","27511":"to go somewhere with sb, especially when you have not been asked or invited","28799":"the movement of messages and signals through an electronic communication system","21295":"a person or group of people, especially as a source of help, information or a reaction","11506":"a female worker","23979":"to make people laugh at sb\/sth by copying them\/it in a funny way","27046":"done immediately, without paying attention to the normal process that should be followed","27539":"to test or measure sth","6854":"to be about sth","25952":"of an object","21028":"to earn the large amount of money mentioned","10585":"in support of sb\/sth","2157":"a living creature","28350":"to restrict sb's freedom, for example by making them accept particular conditions or by keeping them busy","28531":"in addition to; as well as","20838":"according to the most exact meaning of the word","9707":"the horse, runner, team, etc. that is expected to win","26664":"to become or make sb become too anxious or tired to be able to relax","10925":"treating sb as a friend","20377":"of a woman or female animal","11298":"a group of people of similar age involved in a particular activity","30606":"a piece of news that is spread by being talked about but may not be true","16710":"what is remembered about sb after they have died","17483":"to force sb to give you a definite promise or tell you exactly what they intend to do","11400":"to make sb feel sad or depressed","9404":"to be watching sb carefully, especially to check that they do not do anything wrong","30790":"to say that you hope that sb will be happy, lucky, etc","25274":"the quality of sth that people and animals sense through their noses","22970":"having large and dangerous waves","6896":"of people or behaviour","15210":"to put sb\/sth in a particular position or state, especially a difficult or unpleasant one","21928":"a person who agrees to write a reference, for you, for example when you are applying for a job","10587":"used to show a reason or cause","11809":"the act of kicking or hitting the ball into the goal; a point that is scored for this","446":"a thing that sb is responsible for (and that other people should not be concerned with)","23329":"available to be bought, especially in a shop\/store","12187":"to gather into a group; to make sb\/sth form a group","17083":"to shape clay, etc. in order to make sth","7298":"showing a person's determination to do sth","28706":"a competition in the Middle Ages between soldiers on horseback fighting to show courage and skill","22427":"to have to report to sb\/sth with authority or in a higher position and explain to them what you have done","4128":"to change from one system or position to another","5068":"to improve or develop in the way that you want","11508":"used especially as a form of address by women","28677":"to improve sth by changing or adding to it slightly","26145":"to be at a particular level, amount, height, etc","18668":"to feel that you ought to do sth for sb or give them sth, especially because they have done sth for you","20702":"a statement about what you believe, feel or think about sth, that is sometimes made publicly","30743":"the far left or right side of the sports field","19559":"a coin of the value mentioned","10427":"the coloured part of a plant from which the seed or fruit develops.

Most golf courses consist of 18 holes. To make play more difficult they are often hilly and have various natural and man-made hazards such as lakes, bunkers (= pits filled with sand), and rough, long grass or trees on either side of the fairway.Each player has their own ball and several different types of club (woods, irons and a putter) with which to hit it. The club chosen depends on the type of shot the player needs to make. In professional tournamentsplayers have a caddie to carry the bag of clubs from one hole to the next and to advise them on their play. Players try to finish each hole in a given number of shots, which is known as par. If they use one shot less than par they score a birdie; if they use two shots less they score an eagle; if they use three shots under par they score an albatross. If they manage to get the ball into the hole in a single shot they can claim a hole in one. If they use a shot more than par they score a bogey. A handicap is an advantage given to weaker players which is expressed as a number related to the number of shots above par. Professional golfers have a handicap of zero. At the end of a round (= all 18 holes), the player with the lowest score is the winner. Professional matches may consist of several rounds. The result sometimes depends on the total number of shots players have taken (stroke play), or else on the number of individual holes each player has won (match play).Golf began as a sport of the upper classes and in Britain it continues to attract mainly people in business and the professions. The game is quite expensive to play and membership of the most popular golf clubs may cost a lot of money. The most famous British clubs include the Royal and Ancient at St Andrews, where the first official rules of golf were agreed in 1754, Muirfield and Wentworth. Golf may have been taken to America by people from Scotland in the 17th century, but the first permanent club was not established there until 1888, in Yonkers, New York.There are four important international competitions for professional golfers, known as the majors, three of them held in the US. The  Masters Tournament is always held at Augusta, Georgia. The others are the  US Open and the US PGA Championship. The  British Open is regarded as the world\u2019s top golf tournament. US and European teams also compete every two years in the Ryder Cup. The major US competitions for women include the US Women\u2019s Open and the LPGA Women\u2019s Championship.

Almost everybody over the age of 15 is a driver and most households have a vehicle. American life is arranged so that people can do most things from their cars. There are drive-in banks, post offices, restaurants, movie theatres and even some churches.In Britain the proportion of the population who are drivers is slightly less but, as in the US, many people prefer to use their car rather than public transport, because it is more convenient and because they like to be independent. In order to reduce pollution the government tries to discourage car ownership by making driving expensive. In particular, it puts a heavy tax on petrol and increases the annual road tax for cars that cause heavy pollution. Congestion charging is used to persuade people to avoid driving their cars in city centres.To many people the make and quality of their car reflects their status in society, and it is important to them to get a smart new car every few years. In Britain since 2001 the registration number of a car shows the place and date of registration but older number plates can be used and a personalized number plate (= a registration number that spells out the owner\u2019s name or initials) may also suggest status. Many people prefer to buy a small, economical car, or get a second-hand one. Cars in the US are often larger than those in Britain and though petrol\/gas is cheaper, insurance is expensive. In the US car license plates, commonly called tags, are given by the states. New ones must be bought every two or three years, or when a driver moves to another state. The states use the plates to advertise themselves: Alabama plates say \u2018The heart of Dixie\u2019 and have a small heart on them, and Illinois has \u2018The land of Lincoln\u2019.In Britain, before a person can get a driving licence they must pass an official driving test, which includes a written test of the  Highway Code and a practical driving exam. Only people aged 17 or over are allowed to drive. Learner drivers who have a provisional driving licence must display an L-plate, a large red \u2018L\u2019, on their car, and be supervised by a qualified driver. The US has no national driver\u2019s license (AmE), but instead licences are issued by each state. Most require written tests, an eye test and a short practical test. The minimum age for getting a licence is normally 16, although some states will issue a learner\u2019s permit to drivers as young as 14. Many states now apply a system of graduated licenses in which young drivers are first required to have an intermediate license for a period of time before being given a full license. An intermediate licence may, for example, prevent driving alone at particular times of the day or require the driver to take special classes if they drive badly. Americans have to get a new driver\u2019s licence if they move to another state.In Britain people drive on the left and in the US they drive on the right. Generally British and US drivers are relatively careful and courteous but there is dangerous driving. In the US many of the deaths due to traffic accidents are caused by drivers who have drunk alcohol. Drink-driving (AmE driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated) (= driving a car after drinking alcohol) is also a serious problem in Britain. On many British roads speed cameras have been set up to catch drivers who go too fast. In the US the main job of state highway patrols is to prevent speeding.Many drivers belong to a motoring organization in case their car breaks down. In Britain the main ones are the AA (Automobile Association) and the RAC (Royal Automobile Club), and in the US the largest is the American Automobile Association.","23349":"to save sth for the future, secretly and usually dishonestly","10316":"able to bend easily without breaking","23841":"the state of feeling happy and safe from danger or worry","23142":"to become different in a particular way, especially a bad way","2347":"to advertise or describe sb\/sth in a particular way","20229":"a container made of glass, clay or plastic, used for storing food in","24094":"to continue doing sth, especially working or staying in prison, for a fixed period of time that has been set","26683":"the ability to be made longer or wider without breaking or tearing","29232":"to clean sth thoroughly by removing the contents and organizing them again","19336":"a length of time which is a division of an era.

They are often also called blood sports because they involve killing animals. In Britain all three sports were traditionally associated with the upper classes, although today they all, especially fishing, attract a much wider group of people. Fox-hunting, usually called just \u2018hunting\u2019 in Britain, was until recently the most common form of hunting. A pack of specially trained dogs (called foxhounds) chase after and kill a fox while a group of people follow on horseback, traditionally wearing pink (= red jackets) and blowing horns. Fox-hunting was once a popular subject for painting and some English country pubs display sets of prints. Fox-hunting, together with stag-hunting (= the hunting of male deer), hare coursing, in which greyhoundschase after a hare (= a type of rabbit) are now illegal, as are other blood sports such as badger-baiting and cockfighting.The ban on hunting was an important political issue in Britain. Many people believe hunting is cruel and should be stopped, but some people living in the country see the ban as an attack on their way of life. The ban finally came into effect in 2005. Organizations opposed to hunting with dogs include the League Against Cruel Sports and the RSPCA ( Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals). The main organization in favour is the Countryside Alliance.Shooting game birds, such as pheasant and grouse, is a sport mainly of the upper and middle classes. Grouse shooting begins each year on 12 August, the  Glorious Twelfth, and takes place mainly in Scotland. The hunters often employ beaters to drive the birds towards their guns. Those who object to shooting at live birds for sport do clay pigeon shooting (= shooting at clay discs fired into the air).Fishing, often called angling, is a very popular sport and there are many angling clubs. Three main types of angling take place:  fly-fishing, coarse fishing and sea fishing. Fly-fishing, which is expensive, is fishing for salmon, trout and other fish in fast-flowing rivers, using specially disguised hooks. Coarse fishing in rivers and lakes for fish other than salmon and trout, most of which are thrown back after being caught, is more widely popular. On the coast people may fish with a rod and line from a boat or from the shore.The US probably has more hunting organizations than any other country. This is mainly because of two strong traditions: the Constitution gives all Americans the right to own guns, and Americans have always hunted animals for food. The first Europeans who settled America hunted deer, bear, foxes, turkeys and ducks to survive, and many Americans still eat what they shoot. For these reasons, hunting is a sport for all classes and many people own hunting rifles. Americans do not use the name field sports. Instead they say outdoor sports or, because that can include camping, walking and boating, simply hunting and fishing. Bird hunting is often used instead of shooting, because that can also mean shooting at targets made of wood.Many other Americans are against hunting, but animal rights groups have little power against organizations like the National Rifle Association, which has more than 4 million members, and other politically active groups that support hunting and fishing. Conservation organizations like the Colorado Wildlife Coalition also use their influence to protect the rights of people to hunt and fish.The first US hunting club, the Gloucester Fox Hunting Club, was established in 1766 in Philadelphia. Fox-hunting now only takes place in a few eastern states where it is associated with the upper class and has little opposition. Americans generally hunt deer, elk, bear, antelope, mountain lion, raccoon and wild birds. The US Fish and Wildlife Service is in charge of fishing and hunting laws. States have their own wildlife departments and sometimes both national and state permission is needed to hunt.Fishing is the most popular outdoor sport in America. Freshwater (= river) fish caught in the US include trout, bass and salmon.

It is a popular sport to play and watch, with many families going to watch baseball games on a Sunday afternoon. Baseball has become an important part of US culture with many baseball terms becoming part of the language and it is the subject of songs, novels and films. Baseball shirts and caps have also become fashionable in many countries.Baseball is played with long wooden bats and a small, hard ball, by two teams of nine players each. The infield has three bases (= bags filled with sand) and a home plate arranged in a diamond. The pitcher, who throws the ball to the batter, stands in the centre of the diamond. Each game lasts nine innings and in each inning the visiting team is first to bat (= hit the ball) while the home team plays defense. Players bat in turn but when a team has three outs it must let the other side bat. If a batter hits the ball and it is not caught in the air for an out, he runs to first base. If the ball is thrown to first base before he gets there, he is out and if not, he then tries to run to second base, third base and back to home for a run while other players bat. The team that scores the most runs is the winner. Major League Baseball is organized into the American League and the National League and the season lasts from April to October. At the end of the season, the four best teams in each league play to decide which two teams will go forward to the World Series. Well-known teams include New York Yankees, the Boston Red Sox, the Cleveland Indians, the Detroit Tigers, the Chicago Cubs, the St Louis Cardinals, the Atlanta Braves and the Los Angeles Dodgers.","30679":"very good, enjoyable or exciting","27656":"to discuss sth thoroughly in order to make a decision, solve a problem, etc","18973":"greater than usual; special","28763":"to find sb\/sth after searching in several different places","17219":"in the morning of each day","12953":"with admiration or praise","5163":"to be faced with or opposed by sb\/sth","22762":"to do sth that you know is not really a good idea or may not succeed","14310":"to make sb learn about sth or do sth for the first time","22878":"to be easily defeated without even trying","8048":"to make or write sth that needs careful thought or planning","25399":"a particular community of people who share the same customs, laws, etc","5304":"a group of people together","15212":"to prepare sth in detail","11020":"to increase sth; to make sth stronger","5059":"to reach a point where you realize, understand or believe sth","11358":"to become infected with an illness; to suffer from a pain, etc","4178":"a position of having control over sb\/sth; responsibility for sb\/sth","4893":"to write or print words, letters, numbers, etc. on sth so that you know what it is, what group it belongs to, etc","25169":"to go somewhere quickly and quietly, especially without being noticed","9479":"to not pass a test or an exam; to decide that sb\/sth has not passed a test or an exam","26427":"of a person or their behaviour","7916":"used when you are saying that sth is probable","5594":"(of two or more things or people) having a link between them","20311":"a thing that is done regularly; a habit or a custom","7721":"the act of giving or delivering sth to a number of people","7417":"to push or press sth into sth else","10268":"dull; lacking interest or enthusiasm","21266":"of approval, support, etc.","393":"to change the time or date of an event so that it takes place earlier","13175":"to or at the place where you live","6991":"to take part in a competition that you won the last time and try to win it again","9173":"connected with managing a business or an organization, and with making plans and decisions","28668":"to reach a particular level, etc","18109":"to fill your time or keep you busy doing sth","27005":"to put forward an idea or a plan for other people to think about","20476":"to make sth from a material, using pressure","3877":"to add up the amount of money that has been received in a shop\/store, club, etc, especially at the end of the day","21029":"of a vehicle or its driver","13086":"to not do sth immediately","28453":"a secret or expert piece of advice about what the result of a competition, etc. is likely to be, especially about which horse is likely to win a race","22836":"to move very fast","21278":"a thing that is part of a person's character, especially sth good","18601":"not inside a building","25420":"not too bright, in a way that is pleasant and relaxing to the eyes","24866":"used to introduce a summary or an explanation of sth that you have just said or done","30561":"used in questions to mean \u2018when\u2019, expressing surprise","8496":"the subject of study that deals with how to teach","21919":"the official who controls the game in some sports","16462":"(in Britain) the title of the head of some schools and university colleges","11080":"a piece of clothing, especially a coat or jacket, made of real or artificial fur","7767":"to separate two people or things","3491":"to ignore or hide a feeling, a mistake, etc","30699":"to use the power of your mind to do sth or to make sth happen","14518":"Britain\u2019s system of justice relies heavily on imprisonment as a form of punishment. Until the late 18th century conditions in prisons such as Newgate were dirty and violent. In the 19th century conditions improved, thanks to the work of reformers like Elizabeth Fry. New prisons were built, in which most prisoners had their own cell facing into a large central area. Many of these prisons, such as Pentonville and Strangeways, still exist today, although Strangeways had to be rebuilt after most of the building was destroyed in riots in the 1990s.The type of prison in which criminals serve their sentence depends on their category. Category A prisoners are considered dangerous and are held in high-security closed prisons, such as Wormwood Scrubs. Prisoners may be kept in solitary confinement if they are likely to harm others. Category B and C prisoners are also held in closed prisons. Category D prisoners are trusted not to escape and are sent to low-security open prisons. Prisoners on remand (= waiting for their trial) are held in remand centres, but problems of overcrowding have resulted in many of them being kept in prisons or police stations. Young people aged 15\u201320 are normally sent to  young offender institutions, sometimes called detention centres or youth custody centres. These have replaced the old Borstals. However, if space is not available young people are sometimes sent to adult prisons. A prison is run by a governor who is responsible to the Home Office, and the prisoners are guarded by warders.There is not enough space available in prisons for the number of people being given custodial sentences. In the 1990s there were riotsat several prisons because of poor conditions. Cells intended for one person often contain two or three. Despite this, some people think life in Britain\u2019s prisons is not hard enough. Some prisons are described as \u2018universities of crime\u2019, where prisoners gain new skills in breaking the law and have access to drugs.There are many British slang expressions connected with prison. To do time is to serve a prison sentence and to have been inside means to have been in prison. Time spent in prison is porridge. Prison itself is the nick, the slammer or choky, warders are screws, and the prisoners are lags.In the US the federaland state governments have prisons, sometimes called penitentiaries or correctional facilities. Counties and cities have jails. Federal prisons are classified as minimum, low, medium or high security. All inmates (= prisoners) who can work must do so. People are sent to a prison if their sentence is for several years. If the sentence is a year or less they are sent to jail. Some prisoners on work release are allowed to leave jail during the day to go to a job. Prisoners often spend the last few months of their sentence in a halfway house where they are helped to prepare for life outside prison.The number of people in prisons and jails in the US is higher as a proportion of the population than in any other country. In 2002 it went above two million for the first time, twice what it was in 1990. Problems include overcrowding and the use of drugs. The fact that over 10% of African American men aged between 25 and 29 are in prison compared to 1% of white men is seen as evidence that African Americans are treated unfairly by the justice system and are more likely to be sent to prison than white Americans.In the US people who are awaiting trial often do not go to prison but instead make bail (= pay money to the court) as a guarantee that they will return for the trial. People sent to prison as punishment rarely serve their full sentence but after some time are released on parole, which means they must report regularly to a government official. It is possible that two people who have committed the same crime may receive different punishments. To stop this happening some states have introduced mandatory sentencing, which means that the punishment for a crime is fixed by law, not decided by a judge.","12765":"more or worse than usual in amount, degree, etc","679":"without any other people","15524":"to become or make sb more cheerful","3032":"to separate sth, using force","15859":"unhappy because you have no friends or people to talk to","9041":"a planned public or social occasion","22983":"shaped like a circle or a ball","12522":"to be likely to hurt or damage sth","2844":"to put a liquid into a bottle","30897":"to cause or produce sth as a result of effort","25773":"especially of liquid","19319":"how well or badly you do sth;

Juries also hear some civil cases (= disagreements between people about their rights) and decide whether a person is \u2018liable\u2019 (= required by law to do or pay something) or \u2018not liable\u2019. In the US juries are also used in both criminal and civil cases, though the rules vary from state to state.In Britain jurors (= jury members) are selected at random for each trial from lists of adults who have the right to vote. They must be between the ages of 18 and 70 and have lived in Britain for at least five years. Members of the armed forces, the legal profession and the police force are not allowed to sit on juries. Anybody called for jury service usually has to attend court for about two weeks, although some cases may go on for much longer. The court pays only their expenses and if they have a job they are paid as normal by their employer. In England and Wales 12 people sit on a jury, in Scotland 15. A larger number of people are asked to attend court and the final jury is selected at random from among them. Lawyers representing either side in a case have the right to object to a particular person being on the jury.After the jury has heard the evidence presented by both sides, it retires to the jury room, a private room, to discuss the case. When all members of the jury agree they return their verdict, go back into court and say whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. In Scotland they can also return a verdict of not proven, which means that guilt in the case has not been proved and the accused can go free. The verdict is announced by the foreman (= the person chosen by the jury as their leader). Sometimes the jury cannot all agree and the judge may accept a majority verdict, provided that no more than two members of the jury disagree. If no verdict is reached the trial is abandoned and started again with a different jury. It is not the responsibility of the jury to decide punishment, though in certain civil cases they may decide how much compensationshould be paid.In the US most juries have 12 members, though some have only six. Otherwise the system is very similar to that in England and Wales. When people are called for jury duty they must go, but people who cannot leave their jobs or homes can be excused. Before a trial begins lawyers ask questions to see if jurors are impartial, i.e. do not have strong opinions that would prevent them making a decision based on the facts. Lawyers can challenge for cause, if they can give the judge a good reason why somebody should not be a juror. They also have a number of peremptory challenges which means they can object to somebody without giving a reason. In some trials it can be difficult to find 12 people who are impartial, especially if a case has received a lot of publicity. Lawyers sometimes do research to find out what kind of person is most likely to support their side, and use challenges to keep other people off the jury. In a criminal trial the jury decides whether the accused person is guilty or innocent, but does not decide on a punishment. In a civil trial they may decide how much money should be paid in compensation. A majority decision is usually acceptable.","14744":"enthusiastic about an activity or idea, etc","9079":"used to emphasize that sth is correct in every way or in every detail","23187":"to accept or start to use a particular idea or method","6271":"mentally ill; insane","21013":"to move your body or a part of your body in a particular direction, especially using force","14946":"to make sb fall asleep or become unconscious","2341":"a piece of paper that shows how much you have to pay for the food and drinks that you have had in a restaurant","28880":"to send an electronic signal, radio or television broadcast, etc","24063":"a set of radio or television programmes that deal with the same subject or that have the same characters","20859":"to ask sb to marry you","8295":"a place where waste or rubbish\/garbage is taken and left","27544":"to experience or be affected by sth","17322":"a group of people who share the same ideas or aims","13831":"used to emphasize a positive statement or answer","4273":"to put a mark (\u2713) next to an item on a list, an answer, etc","6620":"in films\/movies, radio or television","2908":"a small square or rectangle drawn on a page for people to write information in","20971":"how the mind influences behaviour in a particular area of life","21874":"the process of improving or becoming stronger again","3871":"the fact of sb having a disease or an injury; a person suffering from a disease or an injury","12683":"a short summary of the most important items of news, read at the beginning of a news programme on the radio or television","13839":"of a country","8677":"the use of sth","12281":"having done sth illegal; being responsible for sth bad that has happened","19291":"the number, amount, rate of sth, expressed as if it is part of a total which is 100; a part or share of a whole","22925":"the origin or basis of sth","24101":"a business whose work involves doing sth for customers but not producing goods; the work that such a business does","19705":"a building or an area of land used for a particular purpose","6979":"the act of winning a victory over sb\/sth","28355":"to close sth with a knot; to be closed or fastened with a knot","3994":"to praise sb\/sth","9364":"how large, important, serious, etc. sth is","30744":"the area at either side of the stage that cannot be seen by the audience","10524":"to accept advice, instructions, etc. and do what you have been told or shown to do","21576":"a measurement of the speed at which sth happens","7495":"in a direct line or manner","14272":"with spaces between","1832":"a row or series of similar objects, especially machines","3889":"to try hard to think of or find sth, especially when this is difficult","21892":"the colour of blood or fire","20029":"a substance that causes death or harm if it is swallowed or absorbed into the body","12987":"to pay money to borrow sth for a short time","30220":"to clean sth large or a surface with a lot of water","14615":"a newspaper or magazine that deals with a particular subject or profession","15627":"(in some schools) a punishment in which a child has to write out a particular sentence a number of times","9332":"a look on a person's face that shows their thoughts or feelings","30537":"Growing food and raising animals","30465":"something that you do or say to sb when they arrive, especially sth that makes them feel you are happy to see them","6292":"a living thing, real or imaginary, that can move around, such as an animal","6039":"a soft mass of white material that is used for cleaning the skin or a wound","10024":"to discover that sth is true after you have tried it, tested it or experienced it","3749":"a coach\/car on a train of a particular type","5162":"to move towards sb, in order to talk to them","6125":"to do sth that might result in sth unpleasant happening","22857":"a deep continuous sound","24096":"to put food onto plates and give it to people","12410":"if you have a particular situation in hand, you are in control of it","15952":"to have to give up sth; to fail to keep sth","1595":"very shocking","3568":"something that is bought or that is for sale; the act of buying sth","28072":"in, at or to that place or position","14142":"money paid by or to an insurance company","30421":"the part of the week when you go to work","3887":"to describe or present sb\/yourself in a particular way","30405":"A wedding is the occasion when people get married. Marriage is the state of being married, though the word can also mean the wedding ceremony.Before getting married a couple get engaged. It is traditional for the man to propose (= ask his girlfriend to marry him) and, if she accepts, to give his new fianc\u00e9e an engagement ring, which she wears on the third finger of her left hand. Today many couples decide together to get married.The couple then set a date and decide who will perform the marriage ceremony and where it will be held. In the US judges and religious leaders can perform weddings. Religious weddings are often held in a church or chapel, but the ceremony can take place anywhere and couples often choose somewhere that is special to them. In Britain many couples still prefer to be married in church, even if they are not religious. Others choose a civil ceremony conducted by a registrar at a registry office, or, since 1994 when the law was changed, at one of the many hotels and historic buildings which are licensed for weddings.Traditionally, the family of the bride (= the woman who is to be married) paid for the wedding, but today the couple usually pay part of the cost. Many people choose a traditional wedding with a hundred or more guests. Before the wedding, the couple send out printed invitations and guests buy a gift for them, usually something for their home. In the US couples register at a store by leaving there a list of presents they would like. Guests go to the store to look at the list and buy a present. In Britain couples send a wedding list to guests or, as in America, open a bride\u2019s book in a large store.Before a wedding can take place in a church it must be announced there on three occasions. This is called the reading of the banns. Some religious groups refuse to allow a couple to marry in church if either of them has been divorced, but they may agree to bless the marriage after a civil ceremony.Before the wedding the bride and bride groom or groom (= her future husband) often go to separate parties given for them by friends. At the groom\u2019s stag party guests drink alcohol and joke about how the groom is going to lose his freedom. For the bride there is a hen party, called in the US a bachelorette party. Sometimes these parties take the form of a weekend trip to a foreign city.At the wedding the groom\u2019s closest male friend acts as the best man and stands next to him during the ceremony. Other friends act as ushers and show guests where to sit. The bride\u2019s closest woman friend is chief bridesmaid (AmE maid of honour), or matron of honour if she is married, and other friends are bridesmaids. Children are bridesmaids if they are girls or pages if they are boys.Many women choose to have a white wedding, and wear a long white wedding dress, with a veil (= a piece of thin white material) covering the face. The bride\u2019s wedding clothes should include \u2018something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue\u2019, to bring luck. The bridesmaids wear matching dresses specially made for the occasion and, like the bride, carry bouquets of flowers. The bridegroom, the best man and other men may wear morning dress (= a long-tailed jacket, dark trousers and a top hat) or, in the US, a tuxedo (= a black suit with a white shirt). Women guests dress smartly and often wear hats. Men often hire their clothes for a wedding but women often use a wedding as an opportunity to buy something new.The bride traditionally arrives at the church a few minutes late and enters with her father who will give her away to her husband. The bride and groom exchange vows (= promise to stay together and support each other). The groom places a wedding ring on the third finger of the bride\u2019s left hand, and sometimes the bride gives him a ring too. The couple are then declared man and wife. They sign the register (= the official record of marriages) and as they leave the church guests throw rice or confetti (= small pieces of coloured paper in lucky shapes, such as horseshoes and bells) over them.The \u2018 happy couple \u2019 and their guests then go to the wedding reception at the bride\u2019s home, a hotel or the place where the ceremony took place if it was not a church or registry office. There are often speeches by the best man, the bride\u2019s father and the bridegroom. The bride and groom together cut a wedding cake, which usually has several tiers (= layers), each covered with white icing (AmE frosting), with figures of a bride and groom on the top one. Before the newly-weds leave for their honeymoon (= a holiday to celebrate their marriage) the bride throws her bouquet in the air: there is a belief that the woman who catches it will soon be married herself. The car the couple leave in has usually been decorated by their friends with the words \u2018 just married \u2019 and with old tin cans or shoes tied to the back.","7181":"the distance from the top or surface to the bottom of sth","2694":"to cook or wash sth in boiling water;

It is a bronze cross decorated with a lion and the words \u201aFor Valour\u2019, which is hung from a crimson ribbon. The Victoria Cross was introduced by Queen Victoria in 1856, during the Crimean War. It is reserved for acts of the greatest courage and is often awarded posthumously (= to a person who died as a result of their brave action).The highest decoration for members of the public is the  George Cross (GC), which is also awarded for bravery in great danger. It is a silver cross decorated with St George and the Dragon and the words \u201aFor Gallantry\u2019, and is hung from a dark blue ribbon. It was introduced by George VI in 1940.Other highly valued decorations include the Distinguished Service Cross, the Military Cross and the George Medal. There are also medals for acts of bravery by police officers and by members of the firefighting, lifeboat and coastguard services.The US also has many medals for military and civilian achievements. The  Medal of Honor (MH), often called the Congressional Medal of Honor, is the highest military award and is given for \u201athe risk of life, above and beyond the call of duty\u2019. It is a star that hangs from a blue ribbon which is decorated with 13 white stars. It was created in 1862 during the Civil War, and by 2004 more than 3\u2009450 had been awarded. Another well-known military medal is the Purple Heart (PH), which is awarded to Americans wounded in wars. George Washington introduced it in 1782 as the Badge of Military Merit, and the medal today has a ribbon above a purple heart with Washington\u2019s image on it. Other important military awards include the Distinguished Service Cross and the Bronze Star.The highest US civilian award is the  Presidential Medal of Freedom, established in 1945 as the Medal of Freedom. It was originally for military service, but President Kennedy changed this and also its name. The Congressional Gold Medal is also for civilians. The first was awarded in 1776 to George Washington; in 2003 one was awarded to the British Prime Minister, Tony Blair. The Carnegie Medal, another honour for civilians, is given to people who have saved, or tried to save, somebody\u2019s life. On the medal is a sentence from the Bible: \u201aGreater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\u2019.","4051":"Conceding a point and making a counter-argument","13863":"of an instrument for measuring things","19836":"to move a piece in chess, etc","21731":"to use your power to think and understand","12172":"an area of interest, knowledge or ideas","5527":"feeling certain that sth will happen in the way that you want or expect","18313":"to be available and ready to use","9209":"to live, especially in a difficult situation or with very little money","16021":"in or into a position near the bottom of sth","8937":"more with one person, thing, etc. than with others, or more in particular circumstances than in others  particularly","2254":"of the most excellent type or quality","17970":"used to show that you are annoyed about sth","10853":"away from or out of a position in which sb\/sth is stuck or trapped","21205":"to produce or present a play, a show, etc","13015":"to score points by hitting a ball","9583":"not faithful","13132":"to hide in a place","19334":"a particular length of time","4664":"without spots or marks","1327":"help or support","24360":"of clothes or the way sb dresses","10158":"a sudden attack of an illness, such as epilepsy, in which sb becomes unconscious and their body may make violent movements","1424":"an act of using violence to try to hurt or kill sb","6073":"to include sb in an activity","2558":"a large piece of a solid material that is square in shape and usually has flat sides","15967":"money that has been lost by a business or an organization","10542":"a group of supporters","21704":"to understand or become aware of a particular fact or situation","7497":"immediately","20922":"to show other people that you are a particular type of person or that you have a particular quality","14767":"to make an effort to live normally when you are in a difficult situation or when you have experienced great suffering","188":"a written or spoken description of sth that has happened","5173":"an amusing aspect of sth","11402":"to make a note of sth","7824":"giving a record of or report on the facts about sth, especially by using pictures, recordings, etc. of people involved","606":"drinks such as beer, wine, etc. that can make people drunk","13006":"the study of past events as a subject at school or university","25474":"the process of dissolving a solid or gas in a liquid","20751":"to go forward in time","23129":"to move, especially quickly, in a particular direction","18840":"the thin material that you write and draw on and that is also used for wrapping and packing things","27639":"a story created using the imagination, especially one that is full of action and adventure","9180":"physical or mental activity that you do to stay healthy or become stronger","24768":"when you see sb\/sth for the first time","9327":"of a letter, package, etc.","4771":"to reduce the time that it takes to do sth by a particular length of time","27586":"to go to see or visit sth such as a film\/movie","28534":"a room containing a toilet","23446":"to make a computer keep work, for example by putting it on a disk","2288":"to improve your social position through education, a better job, etc","18121":"late Old English","7072":"to need sth in order to be done successfully","2398":"Birthdays are especially important to the very young and the very old. On their birthday, people receive birthday cards and birthday presents from their family and friends. Children\u2019s cards often have a large number on them showing how old they are. Cards for adults have pictures of flowers or scenery, or humorous or rude cartoons. Inside there is usually a simple greeting, such as \u2018Happy Birthday\u2019 or \u2018Many Happy Returns of the Day\u2019. Children expect to receive a special birthday present from their parents.In the US, children who have their birthdays during the school year take a cake to school and have a small party with their class. In Britain children sometimes get bumped by their friends (= lifted off the ground horizontally and put down again sharply), the same number of times as their age. Some US parents have the custom of spanking their child, once for each year of their age.Many younger children invite their friends to a birthday party at their home. Balloons are often tied to the gate of the house where the party is being held. Children wear their party clothes and take a present. They play party games such as \u2018pin the tail on the donkey\u2019 or \u2018musical chairs\u2019. Sometimes parents arrange for an entertainer such as a magicianto visit the house. After the games there is a special tea with a birthday cake. The cake is covered with sugar icing (AmE frosting), and has small candles on top, the same number of candles as the child\u2019s age. As the cake is carried into the room with the candles lit, everyone sings \u2018 Happy Birthday To You! \u2019 and then the birthday boy or birthday girl tries to blow out all the candles with one breath and makes a secret wish.In the US the 16th birthday is called sweet sixteen. In many states it is the age at which a person can get a US driver\u2019s licence, and some wealthier parents give their children a car as a present. At 18, in Britain and in the US, young people become adults and many have a big party. In most parts of the US 21 is the age at which people can drink alcohol legally. In Britain people celebrate 21st birthdays less than when 21 was the age at which they became adults.Many adults dislike getting older and a few lie about their age, saying they are younger than they really are.

Some of the larger festivals last several weeks and include music, drama, art and literature. People travel a long way to hear the top international performers that such festivals attract. Smaller festivals concentrate on one art form, such as poetry. Because the US is so large, most of its festivals are local, although a few famous ones, such as the  Monterey Jazz Festival in California, attract people from around the world. Americans most like summer festivals where they can enjoy art, music and food outdoors.Many festivals try to obtain sponsorship money from local businesses to help cover the costs. In the US events are relatively cheap so the entire family can spend the day out. In Britain, however, tickets may be expensive. This tends to restrict the number and type of people who go to the main festivals, and many festival-goers are middle-aged, middle-class professional people. This in turn can affect the type of music or drama that the organizers put on.Some festivals, such as the  Edinburgh Festival, have been running for many years. A special feature of the Edinburgh Festival is the  Fringe. Fringe events are usually avant-gardeand attract a wide audience. They also get a lot of attention from the critics, and this can help the careers of younger performers. In Wales, several  eisteddfods celebrate Welsh culture and include competitions for composers and artists. In the US the Carmel Performing Arts Festival in California offers a range of music, dance, theatre, stories and poetry.Many festivals concentrate on music. In Britain, the  Aldeburgh Festival was founded by Benjamin Britten. The most famous British music festival, however, is the Proms, held each summer at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Concerts contain a mixture of old favourites and new, specially commissioned pieces. Classical music is less popular in the US, but several festivals offer a mixture of concerts and classes, e.g. the Aspen Music Festival.Festivals of rock and pop music are often huge informal open-air events attended by thousands of people, many of whom camp overnight in a nearby field. The biggest rock festivals in Britain include Glastonbury, Reading and the Download festival, Donnington. There are huge numbers of festivals every year across the US for different types of music. These include Rock Fests, for example the one held near Cadott, Wisconsin and the Southwest Louisiana Zydeco Music Festival which celebrates the music (and Cajun food) of Black French and Creole peoples. The Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis and the W C Handy Blues and Barbecue Festival in Henderson, Kentucky, celebrate the blues.Film festivals are especially popular in the US. The best known is the Sundance Film Festival in Utah. The Hollywood Film Festival attracts big stars, but America\u2019s mix of people from different races and cultures has led to many smaller events such as the Boston Jewish Film Festival and the Los Angeles Asian-Pacific Film Festival. The main event in Britain is the London Film Festival, run by the BFI (British Film Institute). There is also the Celtic Film and Television Festival, which promotes Celtic languages and cultures and takes place in a different town each year in Cornwall, Ireland, Scotland, Wales or Brittany.Fewer people generally attend literature festivals, but in the US the annual Tennessee Williams\/New Orleans Literary Festival has become a major event. It includes performances of Williams\u2019s plays and a walking tour of \u201aWilliams\u2019s New Orleans\u2019. The Dodge Poetry Festival is held every two years in New Jersey. In Britain the town of Hay -on-Wye has a literary festival, and Stratford-upon-Avon has a poetry festival every summer.In the US the most common festivals are arts, or arts and crafts, festivals. For example, the Utah Arts Festival mixes art with music, theatre and cooking.","21981":"all of a country except the capital city","20004":"a place in a wall, etc. where a piece of equipment can be connected to electricity","24568":"used for expressing strong agreement","17556":"that you have naturally without having to learn it","13556":"a person or thing that you think is perfect","28789":"a group of states or countries that have the same central government or that agree to work together","5309":"to examine people or things to see how they are similar and how they are different","17882":"nearer to the north than sth","18793":"two animals or birds of the same type that are breeding together","4393":"to give some money so that a group of people can buy sth together","132":"to continue in a difficult situation without complaining, because you realize that you cannot change it","10860":"without anyone trying to prevent or control sth","18364":"to be involved in military activities in a place","12236":"to agree to be legally responsible for sth or for doing sth, especially for paying back money that sb else owes if they cannot pay it back themselves","18864":"to come together, or to bring soldiers together, in order to march in front of other people","7509":"connected with sex in an offensive way","11837":"a large machine at a funfair or amusement park that you ride on for fun or excitement; an occasion when you go on one of these","5399":"to make sth bad become even worse by causing further damage or problems","20540":"a person or thing that gives people a feeling of pleasure or satisfaction","16991":"used as a form of address by children in some schools to a woman teacher, whether she is married or not","9933":"a battle, especially for a particular place or position","12074":"green vegetables","22220":"an amount of money that you regularly pay so that you can use a house, etc","1266":"a remark that is not directly connected with the main subject that is being discussed","1317":"to give sb sth that they can use, or some work or responsibility","22230":"to say or do sth in order to improve a bad or unpleasant situation","4064":"a group of shops\/stores or hotels owned by the same company","9260":"a new activity, idea or method that you try out to see what happens or what effect it has","7210":"to say what sb\/sth is like","23851":"to become aware of sb\/sth by using your eyes","2260":"the most excellent thing or person","27714":"a light hit with your hand or fingers","20903":"to say firmly that sth is true, especially when you have been accused of sth or when other people do not believe you","14749":"involving people competing very hard with each other for sth","30316":"a means of going into or leaving a place, such as a door or gate","30979":"more seriously or severely","22132":"of a person","19023":"to die.

For most people it is a chance to be at home with their family, spend time on a sport or hobby or go out somewhere. Both adults and children look forward to the freedom of the weekend and to having time to please themselves. On Friday people with jobs may say TGIF (Thank God it\u2019s Friday) and may go to a bar together after work. People who work in factories, shops and restaurants and on buses often have to work at weekends and instead get time off during the week. Sometimes people take an extra day off on Friday or Monday to make a long weekend, especially if they want to have a short holiday\/vacation. Several holidays, such as Memorial Day in the US and Spring Bank Holiday in Britain, are on a Monday in order to create a long weekend. At the weekend (AmE On the weekend) people may do jobs around the house, look after their garden, wash the car, play sport or watch television. On Saturday mornings many US television channels show cartoons. The weekend is also the busiest time of the week for shopping. Shops are open on both Saturday and Sunday. For a long time many British people opposed Sunday trading and wanted to \u201akeep Sunday special\u2019, but there was pressure from some of the larger stores and DIY shops to be allowed to open, and now many people like shopping on a Sunday.Friday and Saturday nights are popular, especially among young people, for parties and visits to clubs and pubs. People also go to the theatre or cinema, eat out at a restaurant, or invite friends to their house for dinner or a barbecue.On Sundays many people have a lie-in (= stay in bed longer than usual). Some people go to church on Sunday morning. In the US many adults enjoy reading the newspaper while eating brunch, a combination of breakfast and lunch that includes dishes from both. Brunch is eaten between about 10 and 12 in the morning and is enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere. In Britain some people sit around and read the Sunday papers. They may have other members of the family round for Sunday lunch. Many people go out for a walk or visit a theme park, stately home or other attraction, depending on their interests. In summer many families go out for the day to the countryside.In general people are very busy at the weekend and often finish it more tired than they began it, so for many Monday morning is the least pleasant part of the week.","12900":"to be slow to speak or act because you feel uncertain or nervous","3175":"to return with sth for sb","26704":"of a thought or an idea","21036":"to help sb succeed in doing sth very difficult","2027":"to have a particular name","6461":"to produce tears from your eyes because you are unhappy or hurt","24767":"when you first begin to consider sth","6388":"a group of people who do sth at the same time;

The traditional full English breakfast served in many British hotels may include fruit juice, cereal, bacon and eggs, often with sausages and tomatoes, toastand marmalade, and tea or coffee. Few people have time to prepare a cooked breakfast at home and most have only cereal and\/or toast with tea or coffee. Others buy coffee and a pastry on their way to work.The traditional American breakfast includes eggs, some kind of meat and toast. Eggs may be fried, \u2018over easy\u2019, \u2018over hard\u2019 or \u2018sunny side up\u2019, or boiled, poached or in an omelette (= beaten together and fried). The meat may be bacon or sausage. People who do not have time for a large meal have toast or cereal and coffee. It is common for Americans to eat breakfast in a restaurant. On Saturday and Sunday many people eat brunch late in the morning. This consists of both breakfast and lunch dishes, including pancakes and waffles (= types of cooked batter) that are eaten with butter and maple syrup. Lunch, which is eaten any time after midday, is the main meal of the day for some British people, though people out at work may have only sandwiches. Some people also refer to the midday meal as dinner. Most workers are allowed about an hour off work for it, called the lunch hour, and many also go shopping. Many schools offer a cooked lunch (school lunch or school dinner), though some students take a packed lunch of sandwiches, fruit, etc. Sunday lunch is special and is, for many families, the biggest meal of the week, consisting traditionally of roast meat and vegetables and a sweet course. In the US lunch is usually a quick meal, eaten around midday. Many workers have a half-hour break for lunch, and buy a sandwich from near their place of work. Business people may sometimes eat a larger lunch and use the time to discuss business.The main meal of the day for most people is the evening meal, called supper, tea or dinner. It is usually a cooked meal with meat or fish or a salad, followed by a sweet course. In Britain younger children may have tea when they get home from school. Tea, meaning a main meal for adults, is the word used in some parts of Britain especially when the evening meal is eaten early. Dinner sounds more formal than supper, and guests generally receive invitations to \u2018dinner\u2019 rather than to \u2018supper\u2019. In the US the evening meal is called dinner and is usually eaten around 6 or 6.30 p.m. In many families, both in Britain and in the US, family members eat at different times and rarely sit down at the table together.Many people also eat snacks between meals. Most have tea or coffee at mid-morning, often called coffee time or the coffee break. In Britain in the past this was sometimes also called elevenses. In the afternoon many British people have a tea break. Some hotels serve afternoon tea which consists of tea or coffee and a choice of sandwiches and cakes. When on holiday\/vacation people sometimes have a  cream tea of scones, jam and cream. In addition many people eat chocolate bars, biscuits (AmE cookies) or crisps (AmE chips). Some British people have a snack, sometimes called supper, consisting of a milk drink and a biscuit before they go to bed. In the US children often have milk and cookies after school.","2537":"of strong feelings","9718":"to treat sb better than you treat other people, especially in an unfair way","6825":"unable to feel or understand emotions","16453":"a man who has people working for him, often as servants in his home","30525":"used when you have not heard or have not understood sth","17106":"to change sth slightly, especially in order to make it more suitable for a particular purpose","7321":"a piece of land with new buildings on it","29663":"that can help you to do or achieve what you want","6139":"a child of your aunt or uncle","22993":"to or at a particular place, especially where sb lives","2171":"used to say that you are surprised or annoyed at sth","19687":"to join in and help with an activity, by doing some of the work or by giving money, advice, etc","5977":"a group of people elected to govern a large town or city and provide public services","15969":"the disadvantage that is caused when sb leaves or when a useful or valuable object is taken away;

The traditional full English breakfast served in many British hotels may include fruit juice, cereal, bacon and eggs, often with sausages and tomatoes, toastand marmalade, and tea or coffee. Few people have time to prepare a cooked breakfast at home and most have only cereal and\/or toast with tea or coffee. Others buy coffee and a pastry on their way to work.The traditional American breakfast includes eggs, some kind of meat and toast. Eggs may be fried, \u2018over easy\u2019, \u2018over hard\u2019 or \u2018sunny side up\u2019, or boiled, poached or in an omelette (= beaten together and fried). The meat may be bacon or sausage. People who do not have time for a large meal have toast or cereal and coffee. It is common for Americans to eat breakfast in a restaurant. On Saturday and Sunday many people eat brunch late in the morning. This consists of both breakfast and lunch dishes, including pancakes and waffles (= types of cooked batter) that are eaten with butter and maple syrup. Lunch, which is eaten any time after midday, is the main meal of the day for some British people, though people out at work may have only sandwiches. Some people also refer to the midday meal as dinner. Most workers are allowed about an hour off work for it, called the lunch hour, and many also go shopping. Many schools offer a cooked lunch (school lunch or school dinner), though some students take a packed lunch of sandwiches, fruit, etc. Sunday lunch is special and is, for many families, the biggest meal of the week, consisting traditionally of roast meat and vegetables and a sweet course. In the US lunch is usually a quick meal, eaten around midday. Many workers have a half-hour break for lunch, and buy a sandwich from near their place of work. Business people may sometimes eat a larger lunch and use the time to discuss business.The main meal of the day for most people is the evening meal, called supper, tea or dinner. It is usually a cooked meal with meat or fish or a salad, followed by a sweet course. In Britain younger children may have tea when they get home from school. Tea, meaning a main meal for adults, is the word used in some parts of Britain especially when the evening meal is eaten early. Dinner sounds more formal than supper, and guests generally receive invitations to \u2018dinner\u2019 rather than to \u2018supper\u2019. In the US the evening meal is called dinner and is usually eaten around 6 or 6.30 p.m. In many families, both in Britain and in the US, family members eat at different times and rarely sit down at the table together.Many people also eat snacks between meals. Most have tea or coffee at mid-morning, often called coffee time or the coffee break. In Britain in the past this was sometimes also called elevenses. In the afternoon many British people have a tea break. Some hotels serve afternoon tea which consists of tea or coffee and a choice of sandwiches and cakes. When on holiday\/vacation people sometimes have a  cream tea of scones, jam and cream. In addition many people eat chocolate bars, biscuits (AmE cookies) or crisps (AmE chips). Some British people have a snack, sometimes called supper, consisting of a milk drink and a biscuit before they go to bed. In the US children often have milk and cookies after school.","17080":"a person whose job is to wear and show new styles of clothes and be photographed wearing them","12095":"not interesting or attractive","5092":"if a price, a temperature, a rate, etc. comes down, it gets lower","13564":"to recognize sb\/sth and be able to say who or what they are","1012":"a person who makes a formal request for sth (= applies for it), especially for a job, a place at a college or university, etc","1334":"a person that you work with, do business with or spend a lot of time with","11018":"to supply sth with material that can be burnt to produce heat or power","27124":"of a computer or computer system","15709":"to be prepared to hear a particular sound","28259":"to make sb fall quickly or violently to the ground","20911":"late Old English","30090":"to wait for sb to come home at night before you go to bed","17070":"a particular way of doing sth; a particular type of sth","26230":"to begin, or to begin sth such as a career, in a particular way that changed later","22440":"to be buried.

When making decisions Scottish courts look for an appropriate general principle and apply it to a particular situation. English law relies on case law, a collection of previous decisions, called precedents. English courts look at precedents for the case being tried and make a similar judgement. A basic principle of law in Britain is that anyone accused is innocent until proven guilty, so it is the job of the prosecution to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the defendant (= the person accused) has broken the law as stated in the charge. If this cannot be proved the person must be acquitted (= allowed to go free, with no blame attached).British law is divided into civil law which concerns disagreements between individuals about matters such as business contracts, and criminal law which deals with offences that involve harm to a person resulting from somebody breaking the law. In civil cases, the plaintiff (= the person who claims to have been wronged) brings an action against the defendant in the hope of winning damages (= a financial payment) or an injunction (= a court order preventing the defendant from doing something). Criminal cases are brought against criminals by the state, in England and Wales by the Director of Public Prosecutions and in Scotland through procurators fiscal.In England and Wales most towns have a Magistrates\u2019 Court where minor cases are judged and more serious cases are passed to higher courts by three magistrates called Justices of the Peace, specially trained members of the public. The more serious cases are heard in a Crown Court by a judge and a jury. Minor civil cases, such as divorce and bankruptcy, are heard in the county courts and more serious ones in the High Court of Justice. Appeals against decisions from the Crown Court or the High Court go to the Court of Appeal and a few cases, where a question of law is in doubt, are passed to the House of Lords.In Scotland, criminal cases are heard in District Courts by members of the public called lay justices. More serious cases go to regional sheriff courts and are heard by the sheriff and a jury. Appeals go to the High Court of Justiciary in Edinburgh. Civil cases begin in the sheriff court and may go on appeal to the Court of Session.In the US, the judicial system is one of the three branches of the federal government, but the legal system operates at many levels with state, county and city courts as well as federal courts. The right to trial by jury is provided by the Constitution. Each type of court has its own jurisdiction, that is it deals with certain kinds of cases. Both civil and criminal cases are first heard in trial courts and there is a right to appeal against the court\u2019s decision in a court of appeals. Many states have family courts where people get divorced and small claims courts which deal with small amounts of money. States also have trial courts, which hear a wider range of cases, and courts of appeal called superior courts or district courts. Most states have a supreme court where the most serious appeals are held. States have their own criminal code, but some crimes are federal offences, i.e. against federal law, and crimes may fall under federal jurisdiction if more than one state is involved.Most courts have only one judge, but some higher courts have several. In the US Supreme Court, the nine judges are called justices. The people on either side of a case are represented by lawyers, also called attorneys-at-law. In a criminal trial the defendant is represented by a defense attorney, or if he or she is too poor to pay a lawyer, the court will appoint a public defender. The prosecution is led by an assistant district attorney or, in federal cases, by a federal attorney.","21929":"a note in a book that tells you where a particular piece of information comes from","16711":"the part of a computer where information is stored; the amount of space in a computer for storing information","16139":"messages that are sent or received on a computer","35":"doing nothing in particular","7100":"an act of giving proof or evidence for sth","24079":"a person who works in another person's house, and cooks, cleans, etc. for them","30266":"an area of water, especially a lake, river, sea or ocean","29875":"a person who has been tricked","24203":"a complete set of equipment for eating with (knife, fork, spoon, glass, etc.) for one person, arranged on a table","12744":"one of a series of races or competitions, the winners of which then compete against each other in the next part of the competition","20062":"socially correct but not always sincere","7783":"the process or result of dividing into separate parts; the process or result of dividing sth or sharing it out","20112":"liked or enjoyed by a large number of people","8952":"when you think about the true, important or basic nature of sb\/sth  basically, fundamentally","2906":"a small area in a theatre or court separated off from where other people sit","12638":"to be in a very bad condition; to be unable to be repaired","17189":"the way a group of people feel about sth; the atmosphere in a place or among a group of people","20452":"to prevent sth, especially food, from decaying by treating it in a particular way","14156":"to become or make sb become accepted as a member of a social group, especially when they come from a different culture","12643":"to dislike sb\/sth for a particular reason","3054":"a pause or period of time when sth stops before starting again","17313":"to change your position in order to make room for sb","9579":"not natural","26416":"a thin piece of wood or plastic that you use for a particular purpose","5617":"aware of sth; noticing sth","24082":"to give sb food or drink, for example at a restaurant or during a meal","18848":"judged from written information only, but not proved in practice","1953":"the reason why people take a particular action","1374":"used to say where sb works or studies","5197":"of sb in a position of authority","27945":"a person (usually a child) or an animal that causes you trouble or is difficult to control","6495":"an action or event that is a signal for sb to do sth","13460":"an act of chasing wild animals to kill or capture them","9152":"to forgive sb for sth that they have done, for example not being polite or making a small mistake","15956":"to fail to get, hear or understand sth","8619":"in, at or to another place","24614":"to make sb feel embarrassed by behaving badly","16861":"Starting a war","23421":"believing or accepting that sth is true  convinced","29414":"in or into a secret place in order to hide from the police, the government, etc","17157":"an animal with a long tail, that climbs trees and lives in hot countries.

It was invented in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts, by Dr James Naismith. He used fruit baskets for the hoops and baskets, and a soccer ball. The first professional organization for male players was established in 1898, and the  NBA (National Basketball Association) was set up in 1949. Games are now played by rich basketball stars before huge audiences. The team seen most outside the US is the Harlem Globetrotters. It is mainly an indoor sport but it is also played with just as much enthusiasm by young people on the streets of US cities.Basketball is played by two teams of five players, but seven other players can be brought on to replace them during the game. The court is up to 94 feet\/29.7 metres long and 50 feet\/15 metres wide. At each end is a hoop (= a metal ring) 10 feet\/3 metres above the floor. The hoop is attached to a backboard and has a net without a bottom hanging from it. Players score two points when they throw the ball through the hoop from an area near the basket, and three points if they are further away. The team that scores the most points wins. The most exciting score is a slam dunk when a tall player jumps up high and pushes the ball down through the hoop. The ball is moved between players by a pass, or a dribble if a player bounces it on the floor. Players are not allowed to push an opponent, but this often happens. When a foul is committed against a player, he or she can have one or two free throws, also called foul shots, that count one point each. If the referee calls five illegal plays on a player, he or she fouls out and cannot play the rest of the game.The NBA teams play between November and June. The season ends when the best eight teams in the Eastern Conference and the best eight in the Western Conference compete to play in the NBA Championship. Women players take part in the American Basketball League and the Women\u2019s National Basketball Association league. There is great interest in basketball at college level when teams take part in the NCAA (National Collegiate Athletic Association) Basketball Championships, called \u2018March Madness\u2019, in March each year. Basketball is also popular in high schools.NBA players are among the highest-paid sports people in the world. Michael Jordan, the richest of all sports players, who played for the Chicago Bulls, earned more than $35 million in the 2003\u20134 season. Famous players in basketball history include Wilt \u2018the Stilt\u2019 Chamberlain and Julius Erving. Together with many others, they are in the Basketball Hall of Fame.Basketball is also played in Britain, where there are national leagues for both men and women. But the sport receives less attention than in the US and, in contrast to the names of teams and players in football, the names of the leading basketball teams and players are unfamiliar to most people.","26530":"to make a short visit somewhere during a trip in order to do sth","28420":"before the usual time in sb's life when sth happens","10571":"to drive faster","1831":"a mass of cloud, snow, etc, especially one formed by the wind","5865":"to change or make sth change from one form, purpose, system, etc. to another","1261":"to one side;

Political parties, charities and other organizations also use advertising. Many pages in newspapers and magazines are filled with advertisements (also called ads or, in Britain, adverts), companies advertise on the Internet and there are also advertisements, usually called commercials, on radio and television.Advertisements in newspapers and magazines are expensive and only the largest companies can afford to advertise their products in this way. Many organizations, however, use newspapers to advertise jobs and these are generally grouped together in the jobs section. Small companies, such as travel agents, advertise in the classified ads columns, where each advertisement consists of a few lines of text only. Shops and businesses, and individuals wanting to buy or sell second-hand household goods, advertise in local papers.The wealthiest companies buy advertising time on television. Famous actors or singers sometimes endorse a particular product by appearing in advertisements for it. Some advertising slogans are known by everyone, e.g. \u2018Have a break\u2002\u2013\u2002have a Kit Kat.\u2019 Some advertisements are like very brief episodes of a story. Tobacco advertising is now banned on radio and television in Britain and the US. Advertisers have no influence over the people who make programmes, even if they help pay for them through sponsorship although there is an increasing amount of product placement, where firms pay for their products to be shown in films or television programmes. In the US some commercials are national, others are shown only in a particular area. National commercials are often fun to watch, but local ones have the reputation of being badly made. Some products are sold on smaller channels by an infomercial, a commercial that lasts half an hour or more and tries to look like an entertainment programme.Other ways of advertising include displaying large posters on hoardings or billboards by the side of roads. Flyers (= small posters) advertising local events or special offers are given to people in the street. Restaurants advertise in theatre programmes, and shops advertise in their own magazines or on their shopping trolleys (AmE carts). Many companies advertise on the Internet.The biggest US ad agencies have offices in New York on Madison Avenue, so Madison Avenue has come to mean the advertising industry. In Britain, the advertising industry is controlled by the  Advertising Standards Authority and  Ofcom. All advertisements must be \u2018legal, decent, honest and truthful\u2019. In the US the  Federal Communications Commission makes rules about advertising. Television and radio stations are required to do some public service announcements (= commercials that give information to the community) free of charge.There are many forms of advertising on the Internet. Just as firms send junk mail to people who have not asked for it, emails are used to advertise products and services. Unwanted emails are called spam. On Internet pages advertisers use banner ads (= advertisements across the top of bottom of a page), pop-ups (= pages that open in front of the page you are looking at) and links to their own websites to attract customers. Advertisements are also sent to mobile\/cellphones.Many people are against advertising, partly because it adds to the cost of a product. People also say that the influence of advertising is too great, and that children especially want every product they see advertised. On the other hand, many people buy American newspapers on Sundays only because they advertise special offers and contain coupons (= pieces of paper enabling people to buy products at a reduced price).","21999":"following a pattern, especially with the same time and space in between each thing and the next","17611":"at a short distance away","293":"to change a book or play so that it can be made into a play, film\/movie, television programme, etc","28139":"what is needed or socially acceptable","22937":"a number of similar things attached together by a string or thread","19492":"to recognize sb\/sth from among other people or things","27605":"of a bus, plane or ship","10962":"behaviour that is not genuine, done in order to hide your true feelings or opinions","12076":"an area of grass cut short around a hole on a golf course","11297":"a single stage in the history of a family","5829":"a place where orders are given or where checks are made;

Americans believe, at least in principle, that it is better to share what they think and feel. Relatives and friends are expected to say, \u2018I love you\u2019, \u2018I care for you\u2019, or \u2018I\u2019m glad to have a friend like you.\u2019 When people are upset they cry, even in a public place. It is even considered good to show you are angry, to let it all out and say what you feel. Bottling it up inside is thought only to make matters worse.In contrast to this is the traditional British reserve, a national tendency to avoid showing strong emotion of any kind. Many visitors to Britain think that because the British do not express their feelings easily they are cold and uncaring. Keeping a stiff upper lip, not showing or talking about your feelings, was formerly thought to be a sign of strong character, and people who revealed their feelings were thought to be weak or bad-mannered. This attitude is far less common today and people are now encouraged to show or talk about their feelings.Most British men, and some women, are embarrassed to be seen crying in public. People are also embarrassed when they see somebody crying, and do not know whether it is better to pretend they have not noticed or to try and comfort them. Women are more likely to respond than men and will put their arm round the person or touch their shoulder. Many people now show feelings of affection in public. People sometimes kiss each other on the cheek as a greeting and may greet or say goodbye to each other with a hug. Lovers hold hands in public, and sometimes embrace and kiss each other. Some British people are embarrassed about showing anger. If somebody starts to complain in public, e.g. about being kept waiting in a restaurant, people around them may pretend not to hear and avoid getting involved.When British people are part of a crowd they are less worried about expressing their emotions.

People often go to the pub nearest their home, known as their local. Pubs have their own character and atmosphere. Some attract young people by playing loud music, others have large television screens so that people can watch sport and there are also traditional village pubs which are often very old and are the centre of village life. Most pubs have more than one bar (= a room to drink in) where drinks are sold from a counter, also called a bar. Often people in a group will take it in turns to go to the bar to buy a round (= a drink for each person in the group). The most popular drinks are beer and lager. Tied houses (= pubs owned by breweries) sell beers made by the company and guest beers from other breweries, and free houses (= pubs not owned by a brewery) offer beers made by several different companies, often including real ales made using traditional methods. Pubs usually sell crisps and nuts and many do simple pub meals such as sausage and chips or a ploughman\u2019s lunch. Others, sometimes called gastropubs, sell a wider range of food and are like restaurants. Under Britain\u2019s licensing laws alcohol can only be sold to people over 18, and children under 14 are not allowed in pubs unless there is a family room, a room without a bar, or an outside area called a beer garden. Before 1998 pubs were only allowed to open at lunchtime and in the evening, but since then opening hours have become more flexible so that pubs can open all day and even for 24 hours if they have a licence to do so. When closing time approaches, the barman or barmaid rings a bell and calls out \u2018Last orders!\u2019, to give customers time to order one more drink. After the bar person has called \u2018Time!\u2019 customers are allowed ten minutes drinking-up time to finish their drinks and leave. Pubs always have a name which is shown on a brightly painted sign hanging outside with a picture on it. Many names are hundreds of years old and may have their roots in legends, such as St George and the Dragon, some are named after kings and queens or historical figures, and others refer to things in country life, such as The Plough or The Bull.","7058":"to help a woman to give birth to a baby","6543":"to deal with a problem successfully","16409":"to become part of a family or group because you have married sb who belongs to it","23686":"a person or thing that causes you to laugh","28374":"very strict and firm","4183":"to ask an amount of money for goods or a service","16890":"to be upset, annoyed or worried by sth","17606":"a short time away in the future","853":"a particular type of person, thing, organization, etc","6090":"the people of a country;

Political parties, charities and other organizations also use advertising. Many pages in newspapers and magazines are filled with advertisements (also called ads or, in Britain, adverts), companies advertise on the Internet and there are also advertisements, usually called commercials, on radio and television.Advertisements in newspapers and magazines are expensive and only the largest companies can afford to advertise their products in this way. Many organizations, however, use newspapers to advertise jobs and these are generally grouped together in the jobs section. Small companies, such as travel agents, advertise in the classified ads columns, where each advertisement consists of a few lines of text only. Shops and businesses, and individuals wanting to buy or sell second-hand household goods, advertise in local papers.The wealthiest companies buy advertising time on television. Famous actors or singers sometimes endorse a particular product by appearing in advertisements for it. Some advertising slogans are known by everyone, e.g. \u2018Have a break\u2002\u2013\u2002have a Kit Kat.\u2019 Some advertisements are like very brief episodes of a story. Tobacco advertising is now banned on radio and television in Britain and the US. Advertisers have no influence over the people who make programmes, even if they help pay for them through sponsorship although there is an increasing amount of product placement, where firms pay for their products to be shown in films or television programmes. In the US some commercials are national, others are shown only in a particular area. National commercials are often fun to watch, but local ones have the reputation of being badly made. Some products are sold on smaller channels by an infomercial, a commercial that lasts half an hour or more and tries to look like an entertainment programme.Other ways of advertising include displaying large posters on hoardings or billboards by the side of roads. Flyers (= small posters) advertising local events or special offers are given to people in the street. Restaurants advertise in theatre programmes, and shops advertise in their own magazines or on their shopping trolleys (AmE carts). Many companies advertise on the Internet.The biggest US ad agencies have offices in New York on Madison Avenue, so Madison Avenue has come to mean the advertising industry. In Britain, the advertising industry is controlled by the  Advertising Standards Authority and  Ofcom. All advertisements must be \u2018legal, decent, honest and truthful\u2019. In the US the  Federal Communications Commission makes rules about advertising. Television and radio stations are required to do some public service announcements (= commercials that give information to the community) free of charge.There are many forms of advertising on the Internet. Just as firms send junk mail to people who have not asked for it, emails are used to advertise products and services. Unwanted emails are called spam. On Internet pages advertisers use banner ads (= advertisements across the top of bottom of a page), pop-ups (= pages that open in front of the page you are looking at) and links to their own websites to attract customers. Advertisements are also sent to mobile\/cellphones.Many people are against advertising, partly because it adds to the cost of a product. People also say that the influence of advertising is too great, and that children especially want every product they see advertised. On the other hand, many people buy American newspapers on Sundays only because they advertise special offers and contain coupons (= pieces of paper enabling people to buy products at a reduced price).","25535":"a group or type of people or things that are similar in a particular way","13136":"the time in December and early January that includes Christmas, Hanukkah and New Year","22011":"at regular intervals or times","19279":"men and women who work in a particular type of job or are involved in a particular area of activity","22735":"an area of land that slopes upwards","23312":"a sheet of strong cloth which the wind blows against to make a boat or ship travel through the water","23140":"if the colour runs in a piece of clothing when it gets wet, it dissolves and may come out of the clothing into other things","22856":"an official list of names","4356":"a leader or ruler of a people or community","4133":"an extra set of clothes, etc","13323":"involving a lot of activity, argument or strong feelings","29106":"a group of companies that work together illegally to reduce competition, control prices, etc","129":"to agree to or approve of sth","8085":"to decorate or arrange sth","14845":"to be lying somewhere not being used","4116":"to put on different or clean clothes","9628":"the act of imagining things;

Seaside towns such as Brighton, Lyme Regis and Scarborough became fashionable with the upper class. Bathing in the sea became popular and bathing machines were invented for people to get changed in. Later, towns like Blackpool, Clacton-on-Sea and Margate, which were close to industrial areas or to London, developed into large seaside resorts to which workers went for a day out or for their holiday. Long piers were built stretching out to sea and soon had a wide range of amusements built on them. Promenades were built along the shore for people to walk along. Rows of beach huts and chalets (= buildings where people could get changed or sit and have tea) took the place of bathing machines, and deckchairs were for hire on the beach. There were ice-cream sellers, whelk stalls, stalls selling buckets and spades for children to build sandcastles, and the occasional Punch and Judy show. In the early 1900s it became popular to send seaside postcards to friends. Children bought seaside rock, a long sugary sweet with the name of the place printed through it.Most British people like to go to the sea for a day out or for a weekend. Resorts like Blackpool are still popular, but others are run-down and rather quiet. British people now prefer to go on holiday to beach resorts in Spain, Greece or the Caribbean because the weather is more likely to be sunny and warm.Americans talk of going to the ocean or the beach, rather than the seaside. Some places, especially on the East coast, have very popular beaches and people travel long distances to go there. Florida is especially popular and at spring break (= a holiday in the spring for high school and college students) it is full of students.Beach activities include swimming, surfing and windsurfing, also called sailboarding. Many people go to the beach but never go into the water. They spend their time playing games like volleyball (= hitting a large ball backwards and forwards over a net) and Frisbee (= throwing a flat plastic disc). Other people go to the beach to get a tan and spend all their time sunbathing. Many people worry about getting skin cancer if they get burnt by the sun and so put on sun cream or sun block to protect their skin. A day at the beach often also involves a picnic meal or, especially in the US, a barbecue (= meat cooked over an open fire).","13085":"of rain or a storm","3921":"to take hold of sb\/sth","5096":"to have come from a long time in the past","20912":"feeling pleased and satisfied about sth that you own or have done, or are connected with","4125":"to take off your clothes and put on what you were wearing earlier","21613":"red and painful because the skin has been damaged","7491":"the instructions given by sb directing a film\/movie","18069":"to obey rules, laws, etc","1827":"an organization that provides various financial services, for example keeping or lending money","11936":"to take or hold sb\/sth with your hand suddenly, firmly or roughly","14720":"to treat or represent sb\/sth fairly, especially in a way that shows how good, attractive, etc. they are","21939":"to think carefully and deeply about sth","19488":"to remove sth from sth such as a tree, a plant, etc","14472":"children of your own","14679":"a young person below a particular age, rather than an adult","25517":"of a machine, system, etc.","3778":"the series of jobs that a person has in a particular area of work, usually involving more responsibility as time passes","22126":"to dismiss sb from a job, position, etc","14072":"to say firmly that sth is true, especially when other people do not believe you","7751":"in football ( soccer ), hockey, etc.","28250":"used after an adjective to mean \u2018completely\u2019","18397":"as different as possible from sth","28714":"a tall narrow building or part of a building, especially of a church or castle","6517":"the growing of plants or breeding of particular animals in order to get a particular substance or crop from them","6542":"to make an illness go away","28246":"from one end or side of sth to the other","27958":"(of a machine or product) to perform well\/badly in a test of how well it works","15887":"to be thinking with pleasure about sth that is going to happen (because you expect to enjoy it)","810":"(= that had belonged to her ancestors )","19815":"a sheet of metal, plastic, etc. that has been treated so that words or pictures can be printed from it","11056":"an amount or a supply of sth","1055":"to take or give sth, especially money for a particular purpose","27274":"to take sb\/sth in or completely cover it so that they cannot be seen or no longer exist separately","12271":"to help sb to move in a particular direction;

The game split off from British football in the mid 19th century when the Football Association forbade players to handle the ball. There are two codes of Rugby football, Rugby Union and Rugby League, which have slightly different rules and scoring systems. In Rugby League each team has 13 players, compared with 15 in Rugby Union. Players sometimes change from one code to the other during their careers.In Rugby, teams try to win possession of a large oval-shaped ball and carry or kick it towards the opposing team\u2019s goal line, the line at each end of the pitch where the H-shaped goalposts are. If the ball is touched down (= put down by hand) on the grass beyond the touchline, a try (worth five points in Rugby Union, four points in Rugby League) is scored. A further two points are scored if the try is converted (= kicked between the goalposts, above the horizontal crossbar). Points can also be obtained from penalty goals scored as a result of free kicks, and from drop goals (= kicks at the goal during play). Players try to stop opponents carrying and passing the ball by tackling them. When a minor rule is broken players restart play by forming a scrum (= linking together in a group) or by taking a free kick.Rugby Union, also called rugger, is the older of the two Rugby codes. It is said to have begun at Rugby School in 1823. Rugby Union is played mainly by men, though there are now some women\u2019s teams.Rugby League broke away from Rugby Union in the 1890s. Rugby had become popular among adults in northern England and many could not afford to take time off work to play in matches without being paid. The Northern Union, later called the Rugby League, was formed in 1895 and soon had many full-time paid professional players. The two codes may reunite in the future, particularly since in 1995 the International Rugby Board allowed Rugby Union players to become paid professionals.National Rugby Union teams from England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland play against each other for the  triple crown. The teams also play with France and Italy in the annual  Six Nations\u2019 Championship, and against Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and other countries. Major international grounds include Twickenham and Murrayfield.Most Americans have little knowledge of Rugby and in the US it is mostly played by amateur playersin colleges and universities. Rugby was first played in the US in 1874 at Harvard University, but after the development of American football in about 1880 it almost disappeared. It continued to be played in California, but it was not until 1975 that the USA Rugby Football Union was established in Denver.

Hockey played on ice is called ice hockey. In the US ice hockey is much more common and is called simply hockey. Both sports are played by both men and women.In field hockey there are 11 players in each team, five forwards, three halfbacks, two fullbacks and a goalkeeper. A hockey pitch (AmE hockey field) is 100 yards\/91 metres long and between 55 and 60 yards\/50 and 55 metres wide. There is a goal at each end. The aim of the game is to hit a small white ball into the other team\u2019s goal with wooden hockey sticks. A goal is worth one point. Each game has two halves of 35 minutes. A game begins with a pass-back: a forward hits the ball but it is not allowed to cross the centre line until another player from either team has also hit it. There is also an indoor game of hockey played with six in each team.The modern game developed in England in the mid 19th century, and the first hockey club was formed in 1849. English clubs are now organized into three divisions. Each year, the winners of the league competition qualify for the European Club Championship. The Scottish Hockey Union runs leagues in Scotland. The sport is not shown on television as much as cricket, Rugby or football and most people could not name any famous hockey players. Hockey is a game traditionally played at girls\u2019 schools. In Britain ice hockey attracts relatively little interest.An English teacher visiting Harvard introduced the sport to the US in 1901. At first it was played only by women, and the first men\u2019s game was not until 1928. In the US the game is controlled by the USA Field Hockey Association. It is less popular than in Britain.By contrast, ice hockey, first played in Canada, has long been popular in the US. It is a fast and exciting sport. Each team has six players, a centre, two forwards and two wingers, all of whom try to score, and a goalkeeper. Players wear skates, and have helmets, gloves and pads for protection. They use long wooden sticks to hit the puck, a small, hard rubber disc, into the opponent\u2019s goal. If they succeed they score one point. The area of the rink is up to 67 yards\/61 metres long and 33 yards\/30 metres wide, and is divided into an attacking zone, a neutral zone and a defending zone.A game has three 20-minute periods. Play begins with a face-off when the referee drops the puck between two opposing players. Defenders try to prevent the opposing team from scoring and can check (= crash into) another player with their bodies. Professional players often have fights on the ice, and the game has been criticized for being too violent. A player who commits an illegal action goes to the penalty box, informally called the sin bin, for a period of between 2 and 10 minutes and the team must continue without him or her.The US National Hockey League has 30 teams, six of which are Canadian. The best teams in the Eastern Conference and the Western Conference play to decide which two will be in the  Stanley Cup. The Hart Memorial Trophy is given to the best player, and Wayne Gretzky, thought by many to be the greatest ice hockey player ever, won it eight times in the period 1980\u20137 and in 1989. Among the most successful teams have been the New York Islanders and the Detroit Red Wings. In the northern states college and university teams compete in three NCAA divisions.","14910":"a room in which meals are cooked or prepared","19369":"your own; not belonging to or connected with anyone else","17545":"owned, controlled or paid for by the government","5633":"the act of preventing sth from being lost, wasted, damaged or destroyed","28463":"to cover the end or edge of sth with a colour, a substance, etc","21020":"to attract the interest or support of sb\/sth","8232":"of rivers, lakes, etc.","3453":"to be destroyed, or to destroy sth, by fire","25807":"the real or intended meaning or purpose of sth","7527":"upset because sth you hoped for has not happened or been as good, successful, etc. as you expected","5702":"the way in which words, actions, statements, etc. are understood by sb  interpretation","24718":"a position or an area to the left or right of sth","23178":"to pass quickly through sth","14366":"a scientific or academic examination of the facts of a subject or problem","6816":"no longer alive","12999":"important in history;

Other money is raised through admission fees, although admission to many British museums is free, and the sale of postcards, calendars, etc. Some galleries obtain money through sponsorship. Many works of art are expensive and galleries can rarely buy them without organizing a public appeal or, in Britain, asking for money from the National Art Collections Fund.Visiting an art gallery is a popular leisure activity. Galleries and museums are friendlier places than they used to be. Many try to encourage children\u2019s interest in art by arranging school visits and many people make their first trip to an art museum with their school class.The most popular galleries in Britain, all in London, are the National Gallery, the National Portrait Gallery, Tate Britain and Tate Modern. The Royal Academy\u2019s Summer Exhibition of paintings sent in by the general public also receives a lot of visitors. Sculpture attracts less attention, and though the names of Henry Moore and Barbara Hepworth are known to many people, few could describe any of their works. Well-known galleries outside London include the National Gallery of Scotland in Edinburgh and the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery.Important art museums in the US include the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Guggenheim Museum, all in New York, and the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, DC. Most US cities and many smaller towns have art museums.Galleries sometimes mount exhibitions of the paintings of one artist, e.g. Turner, that are brought together from all over the world. People are prepared to queue for a long time to see them. Many people admire old masters, famous works by great artists of the past, but have little interest in modern art. New works receive publicity in the media only when they are unusual or likely to shock people. Galleries and museums try to encourage a more positive attitude to modern art but many people remain doubtful. When the Tate displayed half a cow and its calf rotting in formaldehyde (= a chemical used to preserve it), the public criticized the artist, Damien Hirst. There is usually controversy about the winners of the  Turner Prize Some exhibitions bring together all kinds of art, not only paintings, from a particular time or country so that people can learn about it. Exhibitions on subjects such as the Aztecs, art nouveau and the art of Turkey attract large crowds.","678":"not quite  nearly","29196":"to fold sth in a particular way","25493":"used to refer to what sb does occasionally","2397":"a person's origin or the social position of their family","13650":"to think that sth is probably true","4970":"a group of objects, often of the same sort, that have been collected","11207":"a particular type of gas used during a medical operation, to make the patient sleep or to make the pain less","27510":"to give sb\/sth a name that describes what they are or do","10993":"of people or parts of the body","9790":"to think or believe that sth is the case;

Each country within the United Kingdom has a national emblem, as well as its own flag. England\u2019s official emblem is a red rose. Red and white roses were chosen as emblems during the Wars of the Roses. Afterwards, the two were combined in the Tudor rose. Other emblems include a bulldog, often wearing a Union Jack waistcoat, and  John Bull, an old-fashioned, fat country gentleman. Wales has two plants, the  leek and the  daffodil, and the Welsh dragon as its emblems, and also uses the figure of a Welsh woman dressed in traditional costume. Welsh people often wear a daffodil on St David\u2019s Day. Scotland has the thistle (= a prickly weed) as its official emblem, but a  tartan pattern is used on many products made in Scotland. The national symbol of Northern Ireland is the Red Hand of Ulster, which appears on its flag. The  shamrock and  harp are also associated with Ireland and the shamrock is the emblem of the Republic of Ireland.Members of the British royal family and the aristocracy have coats of arms. The royal arms are placed behind judges and magistrates in law courts as a symbol of authority. Below the arms is the motto Dieu et mon droit, French for \u2018God and my right\u2019. Some commercial organizations whose products have royal approval are granted special permission to show the royal arms on their products.The best-known emblem of the British government is the portcullis (= a barred, chained gate) that appears on official government papers. The  Great Seal of the United States, which appears on US money and government documents, shows a  bald eagle, a very large bird which is itself a symbol of the US, and the Latin motto  e pluribus unum which refers to the fact that the US is one country made up from many individual states.Each US state has a variety of emblems, including animals and plants which are commonly found in that state. For example, Michigan has a state bird (the robin), a state fish (the trout), a state flower (the apple blossom), a state insect (the dragonfly) and a state stone (the Petoskey stone). These symbols may appear on the state flag and on official documents.Most commercial organizations, charities, political parties, sports clubs, etc. have an emblem that they put on flags, notepaper, badges and vehicles, sometimes together with their initials. These emblems are often so well known that there is no need for the organization\u2019s name to be added. They may involve a picture that suggests the name, e.g. a picture of an apple for Apple computers, or the name written in a particular way. Such commercial emblems can be very valuable and may be registered as trademarks, to prevent anyone else using them.","9078":"to make sth bad happen to sb","2760":"a written work published in printed or electronic form","25454":"of the colour mentioned and no other colour","11541":"to have a view of sth;
