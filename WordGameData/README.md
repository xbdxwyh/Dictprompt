This folder contains the "Word Game" dataset we collected and organized for the fine-tuning phase of our DictPrompt. The data set is from ["Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary"](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/), and we collected it and used the web tool ["bing-dict "](https://cn.bing.com/dict/?mkt=zh-cn) to fill in the missing parts. The dataset was randomly partitioned into a training set and a validation set in a 9:1 ratio, which can be merged if you wish. In addition, the datasets with the "_ox3k" suffix are those formed using the common words from the dictionaries selected by the ["Oxford 3000 List"](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/wordlists/oxford3000-5000); and the "_rare3k " suffix represents the data set of rare words in the dictionary other than the list.
