Like all close relationships it has had difficult times. The US was first a British colony, but between 1775 and 1783 the US fought a war to become independent. The US fought the British again in the War of 1812.In general, however, the two countries have felt closer to each other than to any other country, and their foreign policies have shown this. During World War I and World War II, and more recently in the Gulf War and the Iraq War, Britain and the US supported each other. When the US looks for foreign support, Britain is usually the first country to come forward and it is sometimes called \u2018the 51st state of the union\u2019.But the special relationship that developed after 1945 is not explained only by shared political interests. An important reason for the friendship is that the people of the two countries are very similar. They share the same language and enjoy each other\u2019s literature, films and television. Many Americans have British ancestors, or relatives still living in Britain. The US government and political system is based on Britain\u2019s, and there are many Anglo-American businesses operating on both sides of the Atlantic. In Britain some people are worried about the extent of US influence, and there is some jealousy of its current power.The special relationship was strong in the early 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister in Britain and Ronald Reagan was President of the US. Since September 11 the support given by Britain under Tony Blair for US actions in Afghanistan and Iraq has led to problems at home and with Britain\u2019s partners in the European Union.","3245":"a work of art made of bronze, for example a statue","3248":"sad and mysterious or threatening","3249":"a small river","3251":"a brush on the end of a long handle, used for sweeping floors","3264":"a program that lets you look at or read documents on the Internet","3359":"a person or company whose job is to build or repair houses or other buildings","3368":"to stick out from sth in a round shape","3375":"the weight or shape of sb\/sth large","3399":"a swelling on the body, often caused by a blow","3400":"a part of a flat surface that is not even, but raised above the rest of it","3403":"a bar fixed to the front and back of a car, etc. to reduce the effect if it hits anything","3405":"a small round sweet cake","3416":"a large amount of money","3420":"to make or tie sth into a bundle","3421":"to put warm clothes or coverings on sb","3433":"the system of official rules and ways of doing things that a government or an organization has, especially when these seem to be too complicated","3434":"a system of government in which there are a large number of state officials who are not elected; a country with such a system","3470":"damaged or injured by burning","3511":"to make sth end by disturbing or ruining it","3517":"caught in the act of doing sth wrong and likely to be punished","3578":"a strong feeling of pleasure, excitement or achievement","3589":"a restaurant or club where cabaret entertainment is performed","3592":"a group of chosen members of a government, which is responsible for advising and deciding on government policy","3597":"a plant that grows in hot dry regions, especially one with thick stems covered in spines but without leaves.

This is often not true. Many older people now study at college or university, sometimes on a part-time basis while having a job and looking after a family. Many students are highly motivatedand work very hard.In Britain reduced government support for higher educationmeans that students can no longer rely on having their expenses paid for them. Formerly, students received a grant towards their living expenses. Now most can only get a loan, which has to be paid back. From 1999 they have had to pay a fixed amount towards tuition fees and from 2006 universities will be able to increase the amount up to a maximum of \u00a33\u2009000 per year. In the US students already have to pay for tuition and room and board. Many get a financial aid package which may include grants, scholarshipsand loans. The fear of having large debts places considerable pressure on students and many take part-time jobs during the term and work full-time in the vacations.Many students in Britain go to a university away from their home town. They usually live in a hall of residence for their first year, and then move into a rented room in a private house or share a house with housemates. They may go back home during vacations, but after they graduatemost leave home for good. In the US too, many students attend colleges some distance from where their parents live. They may live on campus in one of the halls, or off campus in apartments and houses which they share with room-mates. Some students, especially at larger universities, join a  fraternity or  sorority, a social group usually with its own house near the campus. Fraternities and sororities often have names which are combinations of two or three letters of the Greek alphabet. Some people do not have a good opinion of them because they think that students who are members spend too much time having parties.In Britain the interests of students are represented by a student\u2019s union which liaiseswith the university on academic matters, arranges social events and provides advice to students. Individual unions are affiliated with (= linked to) the  NUS. The student union building is usually the centre of student life and has a bar and common room, and often a restaurant and shops. British universities have a wide range of societies, clubs and social activities including sports, drama and politics. One of the highlights (= main events) of the year is rag week, a week of parties and fund-raising activities in support of various charities.Especially in their first year, US students spend a lot of time on social activities. One of the most important celebrations, especially at universities which place a lot of emphasis on sports, is  homecoming. Many alumni (= former students) return to their alma mater (= college) for a weekend in the autumn to watch a football game. During homecoming weekend there are also parties and dances, and usually a parade.When social activities take up too much time, students skip lectures (= miss them) or cut class (AmE) and take incompletes (AmE), which means they have to finish their work after the vacation. In the US this has the effect of lowering their course grades, but most US universities expect this behaviour from students and do little to stop it. Students are thought to be old enough to make their own decisions about how hard they work and to accept the consequences. A few students drop out (AmE flunk out) but the majority try hard to get good grades and a good degree.","7955":"in the direction in which a river flows","8057":"a part of a piece of furniture such as a desk, used for keeping things in.

The distance between Boston and San Francisco, for instance, is more than 3\u2009000 miles\/ 4\u2009827 kilometres. The US began to build the  interstate highwaysystem in 1956. By 2004 it had more than 42\u2009000 miles\/(67\u2009578 kilometres of road. The interstate system greatly helped the country\u2019s economy, but it also hurt the economies of many small towns not on an interstate. Interstates running north to south have odd numbers and those going from east to west have even numbers. They often have only two or three lanes in each direction through the countryside but may have eight or more each way through cities. The New Jersey Turnpike, for instance, has 14 lanes each way near New York City.Other major roads in the US are called superhighways, freeways, expressways, thruways or parkways. There are also many county and local roads, called variously arterial roads, feeder roads or farm roads. Some states have tollways or turnpikes, on which drivers must pay a toll.Interstate highways are marked with red and blue signs showing an \u2018I\u2019 followed by the road\u2019s number. Other US highways have red, white and blue signs. Some state roads, like those in Louisiana and Texas, have signs in the shape of the state. Since 1995 states have been able to set their own speed limits. This is usually 65 or 70 mph\/105 or 112 kph on interstate roads but lower on other main roads.In Britain the fastest and most direct routes between major cities are by motorways, which usually have three lanes of traffic in each direction and a speed limit of 70 mph\/112 kph. Each motorway is identified by the letter \u2018M\u2019 and a number. Main roads other than motorways are called A-roads and are numbered A6, A34, etc. Some A-roads are dual carriageways with two or more lanes each way. Most A-roads now follow a bypass round towns. Narrower roads which have only one lane in each direction are called B-roads. Most roads have white lines and Catseyes \u2122 (= objects sunk into the ground that reflect a car\u2019s lights) down the middle. Only a very few roads have tolls but Britain\u2019s first toll motorway, the M6 Toll opened in 2003 as an alternative to the heavily used M6 near Birmingham. Narrow country roads below B-road standard may be known locally by the name of the place they go to, e.g. Orston Lane.In Britain the  Highway Code describes the many signs placed beside roads. Red circular signs give instructions that must by law be obeyed. These include \u2018no overtaking\u2019 signs and signs about speed limits. Red triangular signs give warnings about possible dangers ahead, e.g. slippery roads. Direction signs to major towns are blue on motorways and green on other roads; signs to smaller places are white. Old-fashioned signposts can still be seen in some country areas.In the US red road signs, like \u2018Stop\u2019, must be obeyed. Signs that indicate danger, as in areas where rocks might fall, have a yellow diamond shape. Arrows indicating bends in the road are shown in green circles on white signs. Many other US road signs are now similar to those in Europe.In Britain there is pressure from both business and private road users for more and better roads, despite the damage to the environment and increase in pollution that this may cause. People who are against the building of new roads regularly challenge proposed routes of new motorways or bypasses. If they fail, environmentalistsset up protest camps along the route of the new road. Recently, experts too have cast doubt on the wisdom of building more roads, saying it simply encourages greater use of cars. In the US there are few protests against road-building. People generally want more roads to make their journeys faster and more convenient.","14289":"of knowledge","14307":"an introduction to sth, especially to a piece of music or writing","14333":"Inuits are a related group of peoples found in Alaska, and also in Canada and Greenland. They are thought to have come into North America from Siberia many thousands of years ago. In both the US and Britain they used to be called Eskimos but the name Inuit which means \u2018the people\u2019 is now usually used and is preferred by many of the people themselves. It is the name always used in Canada. The plural form is Inuits or Inuit. Although they live in small isolated communities, Inuits have a strong cultural identity and share the Inuit language. Other native peoples of Alaska include Aleuts, who come from the Aleutian Islands to the west of Alaska, the Tlingits and the Haida.Many American and British people still think of Inuits as wearing animal skins and furs, living in igloos (= houses made of ice), and eating raw fish which they catch from a kayak or through a hole in the ice. The traditional life of Inuits involved travelling from place to place, fishing and hunting animals, including seals, whales and caribou (= a type of large deer).As in the case of Native-American peoples, the traditional way of life of the Inuit has been changed a great deal by the activities of other Americans. In particular, damage to the environment makes it hard for native Alaskans to find enough of their traditional foods. Many now live in permanent settlements which have schools and other facilities. They still live by hunting and fishing but instead of a sledge (AmE sled) pulled by dogs they may use a snowmobile (= a special car that can travel over snow) or a motor boat, and have guns and other modern equipment.","14350":"a person who has invented sth or whose job is inventing things","14368":"a person who examines a situation such as an accident or a crime to find out the truth","14401":"the act of giving a lot of time and attention to sth you care about","14402":"a romantic or sexual relationship with sb that you are not married to","14418":"a country in western Asia","14419":"(a person) from Iraq","14420":"the round coloured part that surrounds the pupil of your eye","14433":"not arranged in an even way; not having an even, smooth pattern or shape","14440":"annoyed or angry","14546":"either of the two bones at the bottom of the face that contain the teeth and move when you talk or eat","14563":"a type of jam that does not contain any pieces of fruit","14573":"a member of the Society of Jesus, a Roman Catholic religious group","14582":"a spiritual struggle within yourself to stop yourself breaking religious or moral laws","14585":"a person who rides horses in races, especially as a job","14640":"a sport in which two people fight and try to throw each other to the ground","14682":"a bush with purple berries that are used in medicine and to flavour gin","14683":"stuff  property  possessions  junk  belongings  goods  valuables","14729":"the 11th letter of the English alphabet","14835":"the central stone at the top of an arch that keeps all the other stones in position","14865":"to take sb away illegally and keep them as a prisoner, especially in order to get money or sth else for returning them","14959":"a way of twisting hair into a small round shape at the back of the head","14964":"if muscles, etc. knot or sth knots them, they become hard and painful because of fear, excitement, etc","14992":"a Malay or Indonesian knife with a blade with little curves on its edge","14993":"a country in western Asia","15024":"made of or looking like lace","15025":"a boy or young man","15055":"a county in north-west England.

Nicknames were in use before surnames became widespread in the 13th century and were a means of identifying a person. Some nicknames, such as \u201aRussell\u2019 meaning \u201ared-haired\u2019 and \u201aBrown\u2019 referring to brown hair or skin, later developed into surnames.Nicknames reduce the level of formality in a relationship and may suggest a close friendship. Many people are given a nickname while they are still children and may keep it throughout their life, whether they like the name or not. Nicknames may also be given to politicians and other public figures, especially by the press, such as the name \u201aDubya\u2019 often used for George W Bush. This makes famous people seem more ordinary, and also leads to shorter, eye-catching headlines.There are several kinds of nickname in common use. The most popular are short forms, shortened versions of a person\u2019s first name. Some common short forms include: Bob or Rob for Robert, Ted or Ed for Edward, Dick or Rick for Richard, Meg or Maggie for Margaret, Beth, Liz or Lizzie for Elizabeth, and Kathy, Kate or Katie for Katherine.Nicknames may also be derived from surnames. Nicknames for famous people that have been much used by the British media include \u201aFergie\u2019 for Alex Ferguson and \u2018Becks\u2019 for David Beckham. \u201aMadge\u2019 is used for the singer Madonna.Other nicknames, like the original ones, reflect a personal characteristic. \u201aGinger\u2019 is often used for people with red hair. \u201aShorty\u2019, or even teasingly \u201aLofty\u2019, is used for short people. Names like \u201aFatty\u2019, \u201aTubby\u2019 or \u201aSkinny\u2019 that refer to a person\u2019s weight are rude and generally used only as insults. Nicknames based on skin colour are offensive and should not be used. \u201aBrains\u2019 is used for somebody who is very intelligent, and \u201aTiger\u2019 for someone who is brave or aggressive. The Duke of Wellington is sometimes called \u201aThe Iron Duke\u2019 and Margaret Thatcher was known as \u201aThe Iron Lady\u2019 because of her strength and determination. These more descriptive nicknames are less common in the US.Nicknames based on a person\u2019s race or country can still be heard but are often highly offensive. In England, for instance, men from Scotland used to be addressed as \u201aJock\u2019 or \u201aMac\u2019, people from Ireland were \u201aPaddy\u2019 or \u201aMick\u2019, and people from Wales \u201aDai\u2019 or \u201aTaffy\u2019. Members of immigrant groups in both Britain and the US have had to suffer rude names from the native or mainstream population. Nicknames for people in foreign countries are also usually offensive, e.g. \u201aYanks\u2019 or \u201aYankees\u2019 for Americans, \u201aFrogs\u2019 for the French, and \u201aKrauts\u2019 for Germans.The British have nicknames for many other things: a \u201aRoller\u2019 is a Rolls-Royce car and \u201aMarks and Sparks\u2019 is Marks and Spencers. \u201aThe Hammers\u2019 and \u201aSpurs\u2019 are both football teams, West Ham United and Tottenham Hotspur. In the US all states have nicknames: California is \u201aThe Golden State\u2019, Texas is \u201aThe Lone Star State\u2019, and Wyoming is \u201aThe Equality State\u2019.","17817":"a place that is open late in the evening where people can go to dance, drink, etc","17831":"a compound containing nitrogen and oxygen.
