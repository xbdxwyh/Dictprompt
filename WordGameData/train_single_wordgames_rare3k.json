most popular alcoholic drink which is drunk in pubs. Many people drink bitter, a brown-coloured beer. It is sold on draught, if it is drawn for each customer from a large container, usually a keg or barrel, or bottled, if it has been put in small bottles at a factory. Bottled beer is sometimes called ale. Bitter is usually drunk at room temperature. Lager, which is yellow in colour, has more gas in it and is usually drunk cold. Many pubs sell a selection of French, German and Australian lagers. Stout is a strong, dark brown beer which forms a thick white froth, or \u201ahead\u2019, on top when poured into a glass. Mild is a sweeter, darker form of bitter but is less popular. Shandy is a mixture of beer and lemonade or ginger beer. Draught beer or lager is sold in pints or half-pints. Some people drink low-alcohol beers and lagers in order to reduce the risk of drink-driving (= driving a car while under the influence of alcohol), which is against the law. Many people like to drink real ale, beer that is made and stored in the traditional way, often made by smaller breweries (= companies that make beer). The interests of real ale drinkers are defended by  CAMRA, the Campaign for Real Ale, which publishes a list of real-ale pubs and campaigns to prevent small breweries closing.The US brewing industry was begun by Germans who moved to the US, and so the typical US beer has always been like German beer, light in colour, similar to what the British call lager, although Americans do not use that word. Until the beginning of the 20th century there were many small, family-run breweries in the US, but then  Prohibition came into effect and it became illegal to sell alcohol. By the time Prohibition was cancelled most of the small breweries had gone out of business. Today, most beer is produced by a few large breweries, all of whom make similar products. Recently, however, Americans have begun to appreciate different sorts of beer and many microbreweries have opened. These brew and serve high-quality beer made in traditional ways. This movement has even led some of the large breweries to return to traditional methods and materials. The microbrewery movement has been supported mostly by professional people with a high income but, in general, beer is seen as a drink for people with less money, or for informal occasions. People drink beer after playing sports or while watching them, but wine is considered more appropriate to drink with a meal.Many makes of beer in the US are sold in both bottles and cans, though microbrewery beers come only in bottles. Restaurants always serve bottled beer. In some states beer can be sold in supermarkets, gas stations and local convenience stores (= shops that are open for many hours each day). In other states it can be sold only in specially licensed liquor stores or bottle shops. This can be confusing and even embarrassing for Americans when they travel to a different state, as well as for foreign visitors.","19266":"an area of land that is almost surrounded by water but is joined to a larger piece of land","21430":"a feeling of violent anger that is difficult to control","13268":"flat and level; going across and parallel to the ground rather than going up and down","8840":"a person who approves of sth and shows enthusiasm for it","17955":"well known for being bad","27099":"a man who is unusually strong or intelligent or who can do sth extremely well","21368":"to ask sb a lot of questions about sth in order to get information from them","14095":"the quality of a situation in which things are likely to change or fail suddenly","19789":"an act of planting sth; sth that has just been planted","12143":"fascinating  compelling  stimulating  gripping  absorbing","3905":"a person who is killed or injured in war or in an accident","59":"the fact of sb being away from a place where they are usually expected to be; the occasion or period of time when sb is away","13602":"with very bad manners","28785":"a special way of behaving or dressing that is typical of sb and that makes them easily recognized","12450":"the action of organizing or controlling sth","27402":"to visit a place or person for a short time","1174":"having a pleasant noticeable smell","672":"the amount of sth that is allowed in a particular situation","8549":"of people, especially two members of the same family","30640":"late Old English","19797":"to make your hair flat and stick to your head","149":"an extra piece of equipment that is useful but not essential or that can be added to sth else as a decoration","17377":"a painting, usually a large one, done on a wall, sometimes on an outside wall of a building","6694":"a creature in stories from ancient Greece that is half man and half god","27362":"used to address sb in a way that shows affection","10458":"of a bird or an insect","14080":"an official visit to a school, factory, etc. in order to check that rules are being obeyed and that standards are acceptable","30580":"used to say what feature or quality is important in deciding sth","10414":"a loud short piece of music, that is usually played to announce an important person or event","6379":"(a person) from Croatia","15493":"a king or lord","3952":"in baseball","17807":"a US television channel that broadcasts programmes for children during the day.

The word commuting comes from commutation ticket, a US rail ticket for repeated journeys, called a season ticket in Britain. Regular travellers are called commuters.The US has many commuters. A few, mostly on the East Coast, commute by train or subway, but most depend on the car. Some leave home very early to avoid the traffic jams, and sleep in their cars until their office opens. Many people accept a long trip to work so that they can live in quiet bedroom communities away from the city, but another reason is \u2018 white flight \u2019. In the 1960s most cities began to desegregate their schools, so that there were no longer separate schools for white and black children. Many white families did not want to send their children to desegregated schools, so they moved to the suburbs, which have their own schools, and where, for various reasons, few black people live.Millions of people in Britain commute by car or train. Some spend two or three hours a day travelling, so that they and their families can live in suburbia or in the countryside. Cities are surrounded by commuter belts. Part of the commuter belt around London is called the stockbroker belt because it contains houses where rich business people live. Some places are dormitory towns, because people sleep there but take little part in local activities.Most commuters travel to and from work at the same time, causing the morning and evening rush hours, when buses and trains are crowded and there are traffic jams on the roads. Commuters on trains rarely talk to each other and spend their journey reading, sleeping or using their mobile phones. Increasing numbers of people now work at home some days of the week, linked to their offices by computer, a practice called telecommuting.Cities in both Britain and the US are trying to reduce the number of cars coming into town each day. Some companies encourage car pooling (called car sharing in Britain), an arrangement for people who live and work near each other to travel together. Some US cities have a public service that helps such people to contact each other, and traffic lanes are reserved for car-pool vehicles. But cars and petrol\/gas are cheap in the US, and many people prefer to drive alone because it gives them more freedom. Many cities have park-and-ride schemes, car parks on the edge of the city from which buses take drivers into the centre. In Britain in 2003 a scheme called congestion charging was introduced in London to make people who drive in the city centre pay a congestion charge.","30770":"a special piece of thin cloth or soft paper that has been treated with a liquid and that you use to clean away dirt and bacteria","11643":"to look very pleased or satisfied","29275":"used to say that two things are so different that they cannot exist together","14648":"containing a lot of juice and good to eat","25884":"not planned but done because you suddenly want to do it","3312":"a large amount","598":"a country in south-eastern Europe","14515":"objects made of jade","16444":"to kill a large number of people, especially in a cruel way","27982":"the way food or drink tastes or feels in your mouth, for example whether it is rough, smooth, light, heavy, etc","20770":"an object, such as a bullet, that is fired from a gun or other weapon","29549":"not seen or noticed","15851":"the science of thinking about or explaining the reason for sth using formal methods","7315":"a person or company that buys land or buildings in order to build new houses, shops\/stores, etc, or to improve the old ones, and makes a profit from doing this","1293":"an act of criticizing sb\/sth severely","5789":"having a pitch an octave below","2587":"to become healthy, happy or confident","709":"to make things or people follow one after the other in a repeated pattern","26805":"connected with the way in which sth is built or organized","4194":"an open vehicle with two wheels, pulled by horses, used in ancient times in battle and for racing","14857":"an act of kicking sb hard and repeatedly, especially when they are lying on the ground","4707":"to hold sth tightly and firmly","17653":"people who do not have enough money, food, etc","21947":"typical of a particular situation or thing; showing the state or nature of sth","10822":"done quickly and with a lot of activity, but in a way that is not very well organized","6592":"to protect sb\/sth from being hurt or damaged or from the unpleasant effects of sth","23630":"an organization (officially called the Scout Association) originally for boys, which trains young people in practical skills and does a lot of activities with them, for example camping","25355":"to try to find out information about sb\/sth, especially secret information","15919":"to form or bend sth into a loop","25970":"the popular name for Tottenham Hotspur football club.","25182":"difficult to hold or to stand or move on, because it is smooth, wet or polished","29916":"a climbing plant that produces grapes","6754":"a way of addressing sb that you love","1150":"a long narrow piece of water or land that is joined to a larger area","29378":"very difficult to believe and unlikely to be true","26503":"a piece of clothing consisting of a wide band of cloth or fur, worn by a woman around the shoulders; a similar piece of clothing worn by a priest","27293":"to hit sth, especially an insect, using your hand or a flat object","3509":"of the police","28183":"a wild plant with leaves with sharp points and purple, yellow or white flowers made up of a mass of narrow petals pointing upwards.

The name Gypsy comes from the word \u2018Egyptian\u2019 because Gypsies were once thought to have come from Egypt. Some people now believe that they originally came from India. In the US Gypsies are called Roma, and in Britain they are known as Romanies or travellers, although the name travellers is more often used for Irish travellers, a group in Britain who, like Gypsies, do not live in settled communities but travel about from place to place living in caravans. The traditional language of the Gypsies is Romani, and new words are made up from Romani elements rather than borrowed from English.Roma or Romanies, like many other minority groups, have a strong sense of pride in their identity. In Britain, they are sometimes treated with fear and suspicion by the rest of the population and are often forced to move on from places where they stop.Gypsies usually make money by selling new and second-hand goods. Some collect and sell scrap metal, while others do agricultural work. A few make a living from entertainment and singing. The women are known for selling clothes pegs, \u2018lucky\u2019 white heatheror bunches of flowers. Many meet each year at the Appleby Horse Fair in Cumbria.Gypsies have always been associated with fortune-telling. They can be found at fairgrounds predicting people\u2019s future by reading their palms (= examining their hands) or looking into a crystalball. Because of the mystery associated with their origins and their magical powers, Gypsies have a popular romantic image that conflicts with the reality of families living on dirty caravan sites and being moved on by council officials or the police. Americans have little contact with Gypsies and think of the Roma only as exciting, mysterious people who wear brightly coloured clothes and gold jewellery and have unusual powers. The romantic image was taken up by the US striptease artist, Rose Havoc, who called herself Gypsy Rose Lee on stage.

A few are given life peerages, some are made  knights, and many others are given lesser awards. The honours lists are published on New Year\u2019s Day (the New Year Honours) and in mid June on the present Queen\u2019s official birthday (the Birthday Honours). At the end of each parliament before a general election, the Prime Minister recommends a list of politicians for the Dissolution Honours.For a long time honours were given almost automatically to senior members of the armed forces and the Civil Service, and to those who had contributed to party political funds. In 1993 John Major announced a reduction in the number of such honours and said that more awards were to be given to members of the public nominated for honours by colleagues and friends, or by people who admire their achievements. The Ceremonial Secretariat receives nominations and draws up a final list which is approved by the prime minister. As well as the names of politicians and businessmen, it contains charity workers, well-known sports and television personalities, actors, musicians, etc, and many ordinary people. Honours are awarded by the king or queen in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Many of the honours are associated with one of several orders of chivalry. Some of the orders have different grades of membership, e.g. \u201aknight\u2019, \u201acommander\u2019, \u201aofficer\u2019 and \u201amember\u2019. Many people are given awards in the Order of the British Empire. Famous people may be given a CBE (commander rank) or  OBE (officer rank); people recommended by members of the public are usually given an  MBE (member rank). Some people think the Order of the British Empire should be renamed to get rid of the outdated reference to the Empire, but in 2004 it was decided that the name should not be changed. Most honours allow a person to put the appropriate letters after their name. In addition to these honours there are many medals and decorationsfor bravery, for civiliansas well as for members of the police and the armed forces.In the US there is no system of honours like that in Britain, though a number of medals are awarded for outstanding achievement or for bravery. These include the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.","2746":"the process of forming a special relationship with sb or with a group of people","27503":"carefully planned in order to achieve a particular aim","4381":"to be damaged or badly affected by something","28186":"a small sharp pointed part on the stem of some plants, such as roses","20393":"an amount of money that you pay once or regularly for an insurance policy","2044":"the way in which sth is related to sth or influences it","8533":"the sound people make when they are surprised","20140":"the particular area of responsibility of a government minister","26732":"a worker who has stopped working because of a disagreement over pay or conditions","13240":"curved; shaped like a hook","13792":"a tendency to do sth","26483":"to sew the edges of a wound together","8972":"a judgement about the levels or quantity of sth","10644":"a person who comes from a different country","16127":"the great size or importance of sth; the degree to which sth is large or important","24969":"a period of time that a person spends sitting and doing an activity","10460":"a quick, light movement","18571":"a small military camp away from the main army, used for watching an enemy's movements, etc.","17116":"a container that you pour a liquid or soft substance into, which then becomes solid in the same shape as the container, for example when it is cooled or cooked","29478":"United Nations Children's Fund (an organization within the United Nations that helps to take care of the health and education of children all over the world)","21795":"a person whose job is to deal with people arriving at or telephoning a hotel, an office building, a doctor's surgery, etc.","8700":"with walls, etc. all around","13647":"having or showing new and exciting ideas","4380":"to accept a difficult or unpleasant situation without complaining, trying to make excuses, etc","21055":"to be full of a feeling such as excitement or energy","25078":"to order, especially in a sudden or an unfair way, that sth must happen or sb must do sth","14430":"the amusing or strange aspect of a situation that is very different from what you expect; a situation like this","30388":"to lose your interest in or enthusiasm for sth","17415":"a small American wild horse","8013":"one continuous action of swallowing liquid; the amount swallowed","20956":"not genuine; false or pretended","10363":"to take risks or not worry about a dangerous situation that may happen","4623":"of a government","11930":"(in writing) government","22889":"the abbreviation for \u2018read-only memory\u2019 (computer memory that contains instructions or data that cannot be changed or removed)","28809":"a route that is followed for a particular purpose","20963":"the study and treatment of mental illness","21723":"of an animal, especially a horse","17733":"the science that deals with the structure and function of the brain and the nervous system","21063":"to put a lot of money into sth","12756":"connected with the sky","27860":"connected with the real physical world, not spiritual matters","7231":"to say officially that sb\/sth has a particular character or name; to describe sb\/sth in a particular way","29462":"that you do not know or recognize","7156":"to use sth effectively","26944":"dealing with real, important or serious matters","28811":"to walk slowly because you are tired or bored, especially behind sb else","4457":"to throw sth away","9476":"to make a picture or a sound clearer or louder \/ less clear or quieter","20331":"to tell people about a particular religion, way of life, system, etc. in order to persuade them to accept it","22498":"action that a person takes against sb who has harmed them in some way","28482":"having a title such as Lord, Lady, etc.","29687":"of a seat, hotel room, house, etc.","876":"the feeling of being slightly angry","4323":"a shop\/store that sells medicines and usually also soap, make-up, etc","14273":"to become involved in a situation in order to improve or help it","4614":"a person who is or was in the same class as you at school or college","26260":"of a colour","3720":"a piece of high land that sticks out into the sea","21440":"of a pain or an illness","9140":"the act of deciding that sth is not possible","21290":"an animal or a person that is being hunted or followed","23655":"to make an unpleasant noise by rubbing against a hard surface; to make sth do this","2633":"of a person or remark","1296":"to come together as a group; to bring people or things together as a group","14131":"made by or for musical instruments","1729":"a country consisting of a group of islands in the Persian Gulf","11277":"the third sign of the zodiac, the Twins","17860":"ideas, statements or beliefs that you think are ridiculous or not true","15795":"a sea creature with a hard shell, a long body divided into sections, eight legs and two large claws (= curved and pointed arms for catching and holding things).

The term is usually applied to objects that are valuable because they are rare or are of high quality. In the US the word antique can also describe any object that is old enough to be interesting and unusual, or was made by hand in the days before factories. Antiques include furniture, carpets, clocks, china, glass, silver, jewellery, embroidery, and even toys. Any extra information about an antique, such as the maker\u2019s bill or a letter of provenance (= a letter referring to an object\u2019s history and origin) increases its value. Other items that people may collect are called collectables. They may be of any age and include things like the picture cards that used to be given away in cigarette packets, metal signs and beer mats.Many people in Britain are interested in antiques, even if they do not own any. Antique-collecting became especially popular in the late 1980s and 1990s, and towns such as Warwick and Hungerford are famous for their antique shops. People also look in junk shops and second-hand shops in the hope of finding a bargain. Antiques fairs are held occasionally in hotels or conference centres. Auction houses, such as Christie\u2019s and Sotheby\u2019s, hold sales which are attended by members of the public and by dealers.In the US antiques are especially popular with older people. Antiques can be bought in antique shops in large cities, in small shops in the country, in flea markets (= markets selling old and used goods cheaply) or at  garage sales. New England is a popular area for antique hunting (AmE also antiquing), and many people spend weekends driving through small towns hoping to find something special. Antiques that originate in the US include  Shaker furniture, made in a very simple style. Some people are interested in Americana, objects associated with US history such as letters written by George Washington, silver objects made by Paul Revere, or early versions of the American flag. The Antiques Roadshow has encouraged many people in Britain and the US to take an interest in antiques.","29485":"with no people living there; not inhabited","26287":"not moving, changing or developing","22951":"nonsense; silly things that sb says","10722":"a particular method of doing or achieving sth","26005":"a drink made with fruit juice, sugar and water","8647":"used with a title to show that a person, usually a university teacher, keeps the title as an honour, although he or she has stopped working","12788":"a unit for measuring an area of land; 10\u2009000 square metres or about 2.5 acres","22171":"a part of sth that is left after the other parts have been used, removed, destroyed, etc.","16237":"any animal that gives birth to live babies, not eggs, and feeds its young on milk.

Most vocational training takes place not in universities but in  colleges of further education and in colleges specializing in art, accountancy, etc. Some secondary schools now also offer an introduction to vocational training.  NVQs (National Vocational Qualifications) are qualifications that can be obtained by people already working in a particular industry. Colleges of further education run courses to provide a theoretical background. NVQs are awarded on the basis of practical work, spoken and written tests, and coursework. There are five levels, from Foundation to Management. In schools and colleges people can combine study with practical training for particular kinds of employment by doing vocational GCSEs or choosing a 2-year Diploma course for students aged 14\u201319 at three levels, Foundation, Higher and Advanced. There are also BTEC courses in schools, colleges and universities.In the US there are no national qualifications like NVQs, though some professional organizations decide on their own qualifications and some of these have become widely accepted. Much vocational training is done by private institutions which are sometimes called proprietary schools. Although many of these are good, in general they have a bad reputation. This is partly because there are no controls over who can operate such a school. Some proprietary schools try to get as many students as possible, including some who will probably not be able to complete their training.Most US secondary schools programmes do not provide a choice between an academic and a practical track (= programme of study), but most do give students an opportunity to take some practical or vocational classes. Large school districts may have magnet schools, schools that attract students with certain interests, and some of these may have a larger choice of vocational courses.","16075":"a person who writes the words of songs","19424":"Problems at school","17867":"a county in the east of England, part of East Anglia.

People from other countries often think British and American people are sentimental about animals, and say that they fuss over them and treat them better than human beings.At weekends people in Britain often visit farm parks, safari parks (= parks where people can drive close to lions, zebras etc.), zoos, bird parks and sea life centres. In the US there are zoos and aquaria (= large tanks of fish), which are educational, and also amusement parks with animals, like Busch Gardens and Disney\u2019s Animal Kingdom.Television programmes about animals are very popular. These range from factual programmes about wildlife to films starring fictional animals such as Lassie and Tom and Jerry. Children are given cuddly toy animals and picture books. Children\u2019s literature has created many famous animal characters, such as Black Beauty, Brer Rabbit, Pooh, and Ratty, Mole and Toad in The Wind in the Willows. Many animals in books have their own distinctive character: lions are typically brave, foxes are cunning and cats are proud.There are laws against cruelty to animals in Britain and the US. People give generously to animal charities such as the RSPCA and the ASPCA, and there are animal hospitals and rescue centres for injured and abandoned animals. Most are fairly modern, and many animals live in a large enclosure similar to their natural habitat, rather than in a cage. Often zoos keep only animals that cannot survive in the wild or were born in captivity. Some breed animals to put back into the wild and try to raise public awareness about the need for conservation.Many people care about wild animals. People feed wild birds in the winter and some have a bird table in the garden. In the US the National Wildlife Federation (NWF) helps people to create their own \u2018backyard wildlife habitat\u2019.There are often campaigns to save species that are endangered (= that may become extinct), such as wolves and buffalo in the US, and red squirrels and hedgehogs in Britain. In rural areas people generally have much less romantic ideas about animals. In Britain hunting foxes with dogs arouses hostile feelings, especially among people living in towns, but the law to ban it, which came into effect in 2005, is seen by many people living in the country as an attack on their way of life.In Britain and the US many people are concerned about animal rights, especially the use of animals in scientific research and public pressure has forced many cosmetics manufacturers to stop testing products on animals. Several groups, including the Animal Liberation Front and PETA, strongly oppose vivisection (= the use of live animals in experiments) and animal rights activists organize protests at laboratories where animals are used. Sometimes people who work or invest in companies that own the laboratories are threatened.Concern about farming methods in which animals are fattened as quickly as possible in artificial conditions causes many people to become vegetarians or to buy only meat that is from animals that have lived in good conditions.","11633":"a way of explaining sth to make it seem more attractive or acceptable","7560":"a feeling of slight pain or of being physically uncomfortable","12224":"a short, low sound made by a person or an animal (especially a pig)","30689":"in a way that is not controlled","9391":"of ideas, speech or behaviour","23396":"the state of being sensible and reasonable","20612":"fresh and clean, as if new","20960":"causing the user to see and hear things that are not there or that do not exist (= to hallucinate )","17885":"an English county in the Midlands.

A few are given life peerages, some are made  knights, and many others are given lesser awards. The honours lists are published on New Year\u2019s Day (the New Year Honours) and in mid June on the present Queen\u2019s official birthday (the Birthday Honours). At the end of each parliament before a general election, the Prime Minister recommends a list of politicians for the Dissolution Honours.For a long time honours were given almost automatically to senior members of the armed forces and the Civil Service, and to those who had contributed to party political funds. In 1993 John Major announced a reduction in the number of such honours and said that more awards were to be given to members of the public nominated for honours by colleagues and friends, or by people who admire their achievements. The Ceremonial Secretariat receives nominations and draws up a final list which is approved by the prime minister. As well as the names of politicians and businessmen, it contains charity workers, well-known sports and television personalities, actors, musicians, etc, and many ordinary people. Honours are awarded by the king or queen in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Many of the honours are associated with one of several orders of chivalry. Some of the orders have different grades of membership, e.g. \u201aknight\u2019, \u201acommander\u2019, \u201aofficer\u2019 and \u201amember\u2019. Many people are given awards in the Order of the British Empire. Famous people may be given a CBE (commander rank) or  OBE (officer rank); people recommended by members of the public are usually given an  MBE (member rank). Some people think the Order of the British Empire should be renamed to get rid of the outdated reference to the Empire, but in 2004 it was decided that the name should not be changed. Most honours allow a person to put the appropriate letters after their name. In addition to these honours there are many medals and decorationsfor bravery, for civiliansas well as for members of the police and the armed forces.In the US there is no system of honours like that in Britain, though a number of medals are awarded for outstanding achievement or for bravery. These include the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.","8457":"involving or uniting members of different branches of the Christian Church","5940":"a hard substance that is red, pink or white in colour, and that forms on the bottom of the sea from the bones of very small creatures.

It continued long after the end of World War II under the name national service. During wartime, all men between the ages of 18 and 41 were likely to be called up to join the armed forces, unless they were medically unfit or were working in a reserved occupation. Many women were called up to serve in industry or work on farms as \u2018land girls\u2019. Conscientious objectors (= people who did not want to join the armed forces for moral or religious reasons) were at first the target of public insults, but later established a role for themselves in caring for the wounded.After 1948 men between the ages of 19 and 25 were expected to serve 21 months (later increased to two years) in the services, and were often based outside Britain. This was very unpopular with most young men, and national service was ended in 1960. Since then, Britain has depended on volunteers to join the services and runs recruiting offices in many towns. Some young people join an Officers\u2019 Training Corps while at school or university, or become members of the  Territorial Army. From time to time politicians and others call for national service to be introduced again, believing that military life is a good way to encourage discipline among young people.In the US national service is called selective service or conscription, but its popular name is the draft. It was first introduced during the Civil War by both the North and the Confederate States, and was very unpopular. One reason for this was that anyone could avoid service if he paid money ($300 in the North), or hired somebody to replace him. This led to draft riots by poor people in New York City, and almost 1\u2009000 African Americans and others were killed.The US next used conscription during World War I. Some called it \u201aanother name for slavery\u2019, but 10 million men put their names on the draft list. America\u2019s first conscription in peacetime began in 1940 when Europe was at war. A man could receive an exemption if he was in the \u201a4\u2013F\u2019 group for physical or mental reasons, or had an important job. There were also some conscientious objectors who had to take jobs provided by the government.The draft was stopped in 1947 but begun again a year later, and men aged 18\u201325 had to serve 21 months. This supplied soldiers for the Korean War and the Vietnam War. Many young men were unwilling to fight in Vietnam and some tried to stay in college and university where they could have a \u201a2\u2013S deferment\u2019 from the war. Draft dodgers sometimes burned their draft cards or went abroad. Conscription was finally ended in 1973, and two years later President Ford offered to forgive draft dodgers, but only 22\u2009000 of the 125\u2009000 accepted. In 1977 President Carter officially forgave all of them, provided that they had not committed acts of violence. Although the draft has ended, all men must put their names on the draft list when they become 18 in case there is a national emergency.","19637":"a person who is the first to study and develop a particular area of knowledge, culture, etc. that other people then continue to develop","26892":"the act of cutting and\/or shaping hair in a particular style","2317":"the main muscle at the front of the top part of the arm","8555":"of people, especially of three or more members of the same family","16103":"a spicy Indian dish, usually containing meat","15834":"a room at the main entrance to a building for the person whose job is to see who enters and leaves the building","16301":"a large impressive house","1042":"a young person who works for an employer for a fixed period of time in order to learn the particular skills needed in their job","27426":"any of the units into which a word is divided, containing a vowel sound and usually one or more consonants","20933":"a person's particular area of knowledge, interest or responsibility","23955":"The Seminole were the last Native American people to make peace with the US government.

London has two police forces, the  Metropolitan Police, often referred to as the Met, which covers Greater London and has its headquarters at New Scotland Yard, and the smaller City of London Police.Each regional police force is led by a Chief Constable. Police officers wear dark blue uniforms, and constables wear tall hard helmets. The British police force is relatively small, with one police officer to every 400 people. Some members of the public are trained as special constables and are available to help the police in an emergency.Each police force has a Criminal Investigation Department (CID) of detectives. CID officers are chosen from the uniformed police. They do not wear uniforms and have the title Detective before their rank, e.g. Detective Inspector Jones. Individual police forces have other special units for areas such as traffic, child protection, etc. and there are also national police organizations such as Special Branch, which works to prevent terrorism. In 2004 the government announced the creation of a new national organization, the Serious Organised Crime Agency to replace the National Crime Squad and the National Criminal Intelligence Service.Attitudes towards the police have changed in Britain over the years. The traditional image of the friendly bobby on the beat, a policeman going round his local area on foot or on a bicycle armed only with a whistle and a truncheon (= long club), is now out of date. The modern police officer, man or woman, is more likely to be patrolling in a police car and to have less contact with the public. Police officers generally still carry only truncheons as weapons, and though some are trained to use a gun they only carry one in special circumstances. Dishonesty, racial prejudice and excessive use of force by some officers have damaged the public image of the police and in response the police have tried to get rid of dishonest officers and build better relationships with local communities, a practice called community policing. More police do now patrol on foot again, instead of in cars.In the US, law enforcement is carried out by different organizations at the various levels of government. In all, there are about 17\u2009000 law enforcement agencies and they employ more than 800\u2009000 full-time officers. At national level, the  FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation) has about 11\u2009000 special agents who investigate crimes across the US. At state level, state police departments are responsible for highway patrols and their officers are called  state troopers. Each county within a state has an elected  sheriff and the people who work in the sheriff\u2019s office, deputies, are responsible for investigating crimes. Cities have their own police departments. They may be very large in cities like New York, but those in small towns have only a few officers. Most colleges and universities have their own small police forces.The members of the US police force who have most contact with the public are uniformed officers, who patrol in cars and are the first to arrive when a crime is reported. More serious crimes are investigated by detectives, who usually wear plain clothes instead of a uniform. In spite of the fact that police officers in the US wear guns, they are seen by many Americans as being honest, helpful people who work hard at a dangerous job. This is the image that has been shown in popular television programmes such as  Columbo and Hill Street Blues. But in recent years it has become clear that many police officers are prejudiced against African Americans and Hispanics and that in some police forces, such as that in Los Angeles, prejudice and even violence on the part of the police have been common.","14021":"of a quality, feeling, etc.","7923":"a mixture of flour, water, etc. that is made into bread and pastry","7426":"when you digest food, or it digests, it is changed into substances that your body can use","27986":"a country in South East Asia","19549":"of language","6011":"the act or effect of making sb change from moral to immoral standards of behaviour","26363":"of a boat, car, etc.","4336":"a city in Cheshire, north-west England, and its administrative centre.

The traditional full English breakfast served in many British hotels may include fruit juice, cereal, bacon and eggs, often with sausages and tomatoes, toastand marmalade, and tea or coffee. Few people have time to prepare a cooked breakfast at home and most have only cereal and\/or toast with tea or coffee. Others buy coffee and a pastry on their way to work.The traditional American breakfast includes eggs, some kind of meat and toast. Eggs may be fried, \u2018over easy\u2019, \u2018over hard\u2019 or \u2018sunny side up\u2019, or boiled, poached or in an omelette (= beaten together and fried). The meat may be bacon or sausage. People who do not have time for a large meal have toast or cereal and coffee. It is common for Americans to eat breakfast in a restaurant. On Saturday and Sunday many people eat brunch late in the morning. This consists of both breakfast and lunch dishes, including pancakes and waffles (= types of cooked batter) that are eaten with butter and maple syrup. Lunch, which is eaten any time after midday, is the main meal of the day for some British people, though people out at work may have only sandwiches. Some people also refer to the midday meal as dinner. Most workers are allowed about an hour off work for it, called the lunch hour, and many also go shopping. Many schools offer a cooked lunch (school lunch or school dinner), though some students take a packed lunch of sandwiches, fruit, etc. Sunday lunch is special and is, for many families, the biggest meal of the week, consisting traditionally of roast meat and vegetables and a sweet course. In the US lunch is usually a quick meal, eaten around midday. Many workers have a half-hour break for lunch, and buy a sandwich from near their place of work. Business people may sometimes eat a larger lunch and use the time to discuss business.The main meal of the day for most people is the evening meal, called supper, tea or dinner. It is usually a cooked meal with meat or fish or a salad, followed by a sweet course. In Britain younger children may have tea when they get home from school. Tea, meaning a main meal for adults, is the word used in some parts of Britain especially when the evening meal is eaten early. Dinner sounds more formal than supper, and guests generally receive invitations to \u2018dinner\u2019 rather than to \u2018supper\u2019. In the US the evening meal is called dinner and is usually eaten around 6 or 6.30 p.m. In many families, both in Britain and in the US, family members eat at different times and rarely sit down at the table together.Many people also eat snacks between meals. Most have tea or coffee at mid-morning, often called coffee time or the coffee break. In Britain in the past this was sometimes also called elevenses. In the afternoon many British people have a tea break. Some hotels serve afternoon tea which consists of tea or coffee and a choice of sandwiches and cakes. When on holiday\/vacation people sometimes have a  cream tea of scones, jam and cream. In addition many people eat chocolate bars, biscuits (AmE cookies) or crisps (AmE chips). Some British people have a snack, sometimes called supper, consisting of a milk drink and a biscuit before they go to bed.

Many people spend it with their family or have a short holiday\/vacation. It is also an important Christian festival. Easter Sunday, the day of the Resurrection, is the end of Lent and the most important date in the Christian year. Many people who do not go to church at other times go on Easter Sunday. It was once common for people to wear new clothes to church on this day. Women wore new hats, called Easter bonnets. Today, people sometimes make elaborately decorated Easter bonnets for fun. A few people send Easter cards with religious symbols on them or pictures of small chickens, lambs, rabbits and spring flowers, all traditionally associated with Easter.The Friday before Easter Sunday is called  Good Friday and is remembered as the day Christ was crucified (= hanged on a cross to die). On Good Friday many people eat hot cross buns (= fruit buns decorated with a simple cross). The Monday after Easter is called Easter Monday. In Britain, Good Friday and Easter Monday are both bank holidays. In the US, each company decides for itself whether to close or remain open on those days.Children look forward to Easter Sunday because they are given chocolate Easter eggs. These are also popular with adults and millions are sold in the weeks before Easter. Many are packed in coloured foilin brightly-coloured boxes decorated with pictures of cartoon characters. Others are decorated with sugar flowers and wrapped in clear paper tied with a ribbon. Some shops write the person\u2019s name on the egg with icing (AmE frosting). Inside each egg are sweets or chocolates. Smaller eggs with a sweet cream inside are also popular. Eggs represent new life and the start of spring, and children sometimes colour the shells of real eggs at home. In some parts of Britain Easter is a time for traditional events such as  egg-rolling.When American children wake up on Easter morning, they hope that the Easter Bunny has been. The Easter Bunny is an imaginary rabbit, and parents tell their children that it goes from house to house while they are sleeping. The Easter Bunny brings an Easter basket with chocolate eggs and other sweet things, or hides in the house small plastic eggs filled with sweets or little presents.

Patterns depended originally on dyesavailable from local plants, so each area developed its own tartan. Tartans were not at first associated with a particular clan. From the late 18th century, Scottish regiments wore different tartans as an identifying feature, and the design of an individual tartan for each clan followed soon afterwards. The most famous tartans include \u2018Black Watch\u2019, the tartan of the Royal Highland Regiment, which is black and dark green, and \u2018Royal Stuart\u2019, the mainly red tartan of the royal family.Scotsmen may wear a kilt (= a man\u2019s skirt with pleats that reaches to the knees) and sometimes a plaid (= cloak), or simply a tie, in their clan\u2019s tartan. Apart from those who work in the tourist industry, few Scots wear tartan as part of their ordinary clothing. Men wear kilts when taking part in Scottish dancing displays or for formal occasions such as weddings.Many Scots consider it wrong to wear the tartan of a clan to which they do not belong, but this has not prevented tartan, or tartan-like patterns, becoming fashionable in Britain and abroad. For some people tartan has romantic associations with Scotland\u2019s history and its wild and beautiful countryside. Women\u2019s kilts, skirts and dresses, as well as scarves, bags, travelling rugs, and many other articles, are made in tartan patterns. Goods sold to tourists, such as tins of shortbread biscuits, are decorated with tartan patterns to indicate their origin.","18635":"across the land; by land, not by sea or by air","13208":"of a position in an organization","3130":"the giving or taking of bribes","19893":"an act of asking for sth that you want very much, in an emotional way","619":"a situation in which people are watching for danger and ready to deal with it","19695":"having small marks or holes in the surface","3796":"an exciting or brightly coloured mixture of things","21510":"a slope or set of steps that can be moved, used for loading a vehicle or getting on or off a plane","18641":"a period of time in which two events or activities happen together","7657":"having a good\/bad opinion of a person or thing","12962":"to pull or lift sth up, especially your clothing","13149":"Film-making","29439":"the people and activities involved in crime in a particular place","16071":"if a crowd of people lynch sb whom they consider guilty of a crime, they capture them, do not allow them to have a trial in court, and kill them illegally, usually by hanging","358":"mud that is dried in the sun, mixed with straw and used as a building material","20999":"a small amount of water or other liquid, especially rain, that has collected in one place on the ground","18984":"showing too much support for one person, group or idea, especially without considering it carefully","14159":"the act or process of mixing people who have previously been separated, usually because of colour, race, religion, etc","14900":"the fact of being related in a family","29696":"not clear in a person's mind","11935":"global positioning system (a system by which signals are sent from satellites to a special device, used to show the position of a person or thing on the surface of the earth very accurately)","8115":"to go to deeper levels of an organized set of data in order to find more detail, especially on a computer or a website","627":"a false or different name, especially one that is used by a criminal","18658":"to remove a leader or a government from a position of power by force","22355":"the state of living in a particular place","10884":"extremely cold","25595":"a city on the south coast of England.

Under British law all items made of these metals must be hallmarked before they are put on sale. The marks are very small and are usually placed where they will not spoil the appearance of an article.Hallmarks were introduced in Britain in 1300. They are controlled in Britain by the  Assay Offices. Most modern hallmarks include four symbols: the sponsor\u2019s mark identifies the company which made the article; the standard mark describes the quality of the metal; the Assay Office mark indicates the city where the article was tested and marked. A date letter which indicates the year in which the article was stamped, may also be added.The sponsor\u2019s mark used to be an emblem such as a bird, but now consists of the initials of the maker. The standard marks consist of a number which indicates the quality of the metal. The number 916, for example, indicates 22 carat (AmE karat) gold. Formerly gold items were marked with a crown. Any silver items are marked with a lion, as well as the number 925, to indicate sterling silver, which is 92.5% pure. Platinum items may be marked with an orb (= a decorated ball with a cross on top). The Assay Office mark was first added in 1478, when all items had to be tested for quality at Goldsmiths\u2019 Hall (hence the name hallmark) in London. Britain currently has Assay Offices in four cities: the symbol for London is a leopard, for Birmingham an anchor, for Sheffield a rose and for Edinburgh a castle. Date letters are in different styles of type and set inside a shield. Additional symbols may show that the article was made to celebrate a particular occasion such as a coronation or the millennium.In the late 18th and early 19th centuries a system of hallmarks similar to that used in Britain was introduced in the US. Items were stamped with a date letter, duty mark, which indicated that tax had been paid, and a lion. The practice did not last long, and instead goldsmiths and silversmiths stamped their work with their initials or full name. Some added a date, but many items have no date, so their age can only be estimated by the style. In 1868 Baltimore silversmiths were the first to add below their names the sterling standard of 925\/1000 (i.e. 92.5%). Silversmiths in Boston and New York City had guilds which decided their own standards, and items were often marked with the name of the city in which they were made.Items made in the US now must have on them the mark of the person or company that made them and a standard mark. Gold items are marked in karats, usually abbreviated to \u201aK\u2019. Most gold jewellery in the US is 18 karat and marked \u201a18K\u2019. Silver items of sterling standard may be stamped \u201asilver\u2019, \u201asolid silver\u2019, \u201asterling silver\u2019, \u201asterling\u2019 or \u201aster\u2019.The idea of a hallmark as a means of identifying the origin and quality of an item has a wider use in English. If something is the hallmark of or has\/bears all the hallmarks of something, it has all the essential features associated with that thing. If somebody leaves\/stamps their hallmark on something, they have a unique and lasting effect on it.","1843":"completely lacking in anything that has value","25963":"an evergreen forest tree with leaves like needles","5024":"a young male horse up to the age of four or five","29586":"of food or drink","22846":"behaving in a different way from other similar people or things, often causing damage","239":"a person that you know but who is not a close friend","164":"music that is played to support singing or another instrument","22920":"an adult male chicken","1562":"wanting to get sth very much","25696":"a performance or an event that is very impressive and exciting to look at","12757":"very pleasant","9190":"a city in south-west England.

They provided a cheap and convenient means of transport for heavy goods, especially between the mining and industrial centres of the Midlands and north-west England. Coal, grain, clay and other materials were transported on narrowboats, also called barges, that were pulled along by horses walking along a towpath beside the canal. Many miles of channel had to be dug, with some sections passing through tunnels or over aqueducts. Hundreds of locks were built to enable boats to go up or down a hill. A flight (= series) of 20 or 30 locks was needed on some steep sections.In the US canals were used for a short period to transport goods to areas where there were no large rivers. The most famous, the Erie Canal in New York State, ran from Buffalo on Lake Erie to Albany on the Hudson River and connected New York City with Ohio, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Mules, not horses, were used to pull the barges. The growth of the railway in the 1840s soon took business away from the canals, but the canal system played an important role in expanding trade and encouraging people to move west.After the railways were built, many canals were filled in. In Britain especially, canals that still exist have become popular with people wanting a quiet country holiday away from traffic. Old narrow boats have been fitted with motors and converted to provide attractive holiday accommodation. Speed is restricted on canals so the pace is slow and restful. Some locks are operated by lock-keepers, but many are worked (= opened and closed) by people on the boats. Going through a flight of locks is seen as part of the fun. At night, people moor their boats at the side of the canal. Canals are also popular with fishermen, and with walkers using the towpath.

Today, many people in the US and in Britain regularly do crosswords, sometimes on the bus or train on their way to work. Most newspapers and magazines contain at least one crossword and there are often prizes for people who send in the correct solution. Books of crosswords are also popular. Solving a crossword involves answering a set of clues. The answers are words or phrases which fit together in a patterned grid. The clues are usually numbered and listed as across and down, according to whether the answer reads across the grid or from top to bottom.There are two basic types of crossword, called in Britain quick crosswords and cryptic crosswords. In quick crosswords the clues are usually definitions of the answers. This is much the most common type of crossword in the US, where the grids are usually a lot bigger and contain many more words. These crosswords are not necessarily easy, and the one in the Sunday issue of the  New York Times is considered very difficult.Cryptic crosswords, which began in Britain and are much more popular there than in any other country, have clues which contain both a definition of the answer and a word puzzle involving the letters in it. One common type of word puzzle is an anagram, in which the letters of the answer word are rearranged in the clue to form another word or phrase. For example, CARTHORSE and SHORT RACE are both anagrams of the word ORCHESTRA.","9442":"connected with a person's face; on a person's face","13347":"done or happening every hour","24375":"very shocked and upset","27313":"when you sweat, drops of liquid appear on the surface of your skin, for example when you are hot, ill\/sick or afraid","28964":"Starting a war","16848":"connected with, or having the habit of, regular migration","27813":"a message sent by telegraph and then printed and given to sb","3581":"a road that passes around a town or city rather than through the centre","25224":"to seem to contain or involve a particular unpleasant quality","16545":"as great or as large as possible","15108":"to pass another runner on a track who is one or more laps behind you","30880":"an area of land that is covered with trees","24400":"used to emphasize the size, degree or amount of sth","21757":"having experienced a complete spiritual change","9531":"a bird of prey (= a bird that kills other creatures for food) with long pointed wings","25315":"looking or feeling too pleased about sth you have done or achieved","2970":"a flat piece of brass with words or a picture on it, fixed to the floor or wall of a church in memory of sb who has died","8874":"a large number of cases of a particular disease happening at the same time in a particular community","18474":"an order or a rule made by a government or sb in a position of authority","907":"a piece of equipment made of wire or long straight pieces of metal for receiving or sending radio and television signals","7663":"to not consider sth; to treat sth as unimportant","9701":"not perfect; not working or made correctly","19341":"not as important as the main aim, part, etc. of sth","22830":"to shake or to make sth shake violently","21105":"on purpose; deliberately","13308":"a person who is captured and held prisoner by a person or group, and who may be injured or killed if people do not do what the person or group is asking","2532":"approval of or permission for sth","25632":"from or connected with Spain","15794":"a part of an organ in the body, especially the lungs or brain","28291":"to bring food from the stomach back out through the mouth","13703":"the traditional system of weights and measures in Britain which is gradually being replaced by the metric system.

British opium traders working for the East India Company began using Hong Kong Island\u2019s harbour in the 1820s. The island was occupied by the British during the first Opium War and was handed over to them by China in 1842 at the end of the war. Kowloon was gained in 1860 following the second Opium War. In 1898 the colony again increased in size when the New Territories were leased to Britain for a period of 99 years. On 30 June 1997 Hong Kong was handed over to China and it is now a Special Administrative Region of China.Under British rule Hong Kong became a successful manufacturing, business and financial centre. The population of six million people, mostly Chinese, enjoyed a high standard of living and the wealth of Hong Kong attracted people from other countries in the Far East.British control of Hong Kong became an embarrassment to China, and there were great celebrations in Beijing when the colony was returned to Chinese rule. In 1984 the British and Chinese negotiated an agreement to preserve the existing economic system and way of life for at least 50 years after the handover.

Many jeans were sold by Levi Strauss, who had a store in California, and today Levi\u2019s are among the most famous jeans.Traditionally, jeans are blue (and are then also called blue jeans), but the fabric they are made of,  denim, comes in many colours. Black jeans, and stonewashed jeans that are made from denim which has been washed until it becomes lighter and softer, are also made. Styles include bell-bottoms, flares and bootleg cut, which are halfway between straight and flared, but straight-leg is most popular as a universal style and worn by both men and women. Designer jeans are sold by top fashion designers.For a long time jeans were worn only for physical work, but in the 1960s society changed and young people began to question traditional attitudes to dress.

The street runs the whole length of Manhattan, but its 36 theatres are in the Theater District between West 41st Street and West 57th Street. The most famous are between 44th and 45th Streets, near Times Square. This part is called the Great White Way because of its many bright lights. The first theatres were built there in 1894 and New York\u2019s subway system was extended north shortly afterwards to help audiences get to them. Other theatres in New York, usually smaller, are said to be off-Broadway, and there are even off-off-Broadway theatres, which are less commercial.Before the rise of the film industry, Broadway was the place where actors could become famous. Broadway\u2019s best years were in the 1920s when there were about 80 theatres. Most of the longest-running plays on Broadway have been musicals such as  South Pacific,  Guys and Dolls,  My Fair Lady and A Chorus Line. Andrew Lloyd Webber\u2019s  Cats, which closed in 2000, had the longest runwith 7\u2009485 performances. Serious plays that have won Tony awards include  Death of a Salesman,  Long Day\u2019s Journey into Night and  Who\u2019s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? Famous actors who have appeared on Broadway include Dustin Hoffman, Robert Redford, Elizabeth Taylor, Liza Minnelli and, from Britain, Vanessa Redgrave, Jeremy Irons, Maggie Smith and Ralph Fiennes.Since the early 1970s the high cost of producing plays has forced many theatres to close or to become cinemas\/ movie theaters, and Broadway is not as important as it once was. It has had fewer successful new plays and has tried to attract audiences with revivals or with successful British productions. A bad review by the drama critic of the  New York Times can close a play. Paul Simon\u2019s $11-million musical, The Capeman, for instance, ran for only two months after bad reviews. Broadway has attracted larger audiences with musicals such as Chicago and The Producers, but most new avant-garde (= experimental) works are produced off-Broadway, or off-off-Broadway in the lofts (= old warehouses) of SoHo.","329":"a small change made to sth in order to correct or improve it","7209":"a person's family origins","1743":"a person whose job is baking and selling bread and cakes","29678":"greatest; most extreme","31206":"young or seeming younger than you are","30011":"of a person or their moods","11117":"confused and not expressed clearly","19748":"in a way that is easy to see, hear, understand or believe","6129":"a polite thing that you say or do when you meet people in formal situations","20512":"to give sb a short account of sth that is going to happen, be studied, etc","1085":"a curved shape","9991":"a device that allows only particular types of light or sound to pass through it","2337":"the greenish brown liquid with a bitter unpleasant taste that is produced by the liver to help the body to deal with the fats we eat, and that can come into your mouth when you vomit with an empty stomach","13765":"difficult or impossible to reach or to get","10375":"a large group of people, especially of the same type","24076":"Being religious","22909":"the outside part of the roof of a building","13312":"strongly rejecting sth","11973":"divided into groups or levels on a scale","20443":"a person who makes a speech or talks to an audience about a particular subject","1671":"a strong negative reaction by a large number of people, for example to sth that has recently changed in society","14075":"an act of demanding or saying sth firmly and refusing to accept any opposition or excuses","13545":"acting as a sign or symbol of sth","30997":"typical of what a particular person or thing might do, give, etc","21417":"concerning the most basic and important parts of sth; thorough and complete","15591":"a large white or brightly coloured flower with petals that curl back from the centre.

The British government took control of India after the Indian Mutiny, appointing a Viceroy as its ruler. A movement for independence began at this time, when the Indian National Congress Party (later the Congress Party) was formed in 1885. In the early 20th century, the leading figure in the movement for independence was Mahatma Gandhi, who led a campaign of peaceful protest against British rule.

After the end of the Cold War in the late 1980s, and the joining of East and West Germany in 1990, it was suggested that NATO should become a political organization rather than a military one.

An exception is the A1 from London to north-eastern England, which is often called the Great North Road. Roads that follow the line of former Roman roads also have names, e.g. the Fosse Way. If a main road passes through a town, that part of it usually has a name, often that of the place which the road goes to, e.g. London Road.The main shopping street in a town is often called High Street, or sometimes Market Street. Many streets take their name from a local feature or building. The most common include Bridge Street, Castle Street, Church Street, Mill Street and Station Road. Some names indicate the trade that was formerly carried on in that area. Examples are Candlemaker\u2019s Row, Cornmarket, Petticoat Lane and Sheep Street. Many streets laid out in the 19th century were named after famous people or events. These include Albert Street, Cromwell Road, Shakespeare Street, Wellington Street, Trafalgar Road and Waterloo Street. When housing estates are built, the names of the new roads in them are usually all on the same theme. Names of birds or animals are popular. Others are based on the old names for the fields that the houses were built on, e.g. Tenacres Road, The Slade and Meadow Walk. The name of a road is written on signs at each end of it, sometimes together with the local postcode.Some streets have become so closely identified with people of a particular profession that the street name itself is immediately associated with them. In London, Harley Street has been associated with private doctors and Fleet Street with newspapers.In the US main roads such as interstates and highways are known by numbers. Most towns and cities are laid out on a grid pattern and have long streets with avenues crossing them. Each has a number, e.g. 7th Avenue, 42nd Street. The roads are often straight and have square blocks of buildings between them. This makes it easier to find an address and also helps people to judge distance. In Manhattan, for example, Tiffany\u2019s is described as being at East 57th Street and Fifth Avenue, i.e. on the corner of those two streets. The distance between West 90th Street and West 60th Street is 30 blocks.As well as having numbers, many streets are named after people, places, local features, history and nature. In Manhattan there is Washington Street, Lexington Avenue, Liberty Street, Church Street and Cedar Street. Some streets are named after the town to which they lead. The most important street is often called Main Street. A suburb or subdivision of a city may have streets with similar names. In a subdivision of Baton Rouge, Louisiana, all the names end in \u201awood\u2019, e.g. Balsawood Drive, Limewood Drive and Aspenwood Drive.Some roads are called boulevards, with Hollywood\u2019s Sunset Boulevard and Miami\u2019s Biscayne Boulevard among the best known. Avenues usually cross streets, as in New York, but often the word is chosen as part of a name for no particular reason. Avenue and boulevard once indicated roads with trees along each side, but few have trees today. A road in the US is usually found outside cities, though Chicago uses the name for some central streets.Some street names have particular associations: Grant Avenue in San Francisco is associated with Chinatown, Beale Street in Memphis with the blues, and Bourbon Street in New Orleans with jazz.

Almost everybody over the age of 15 is a driver and most households have a vehicle. American life is arranged so that people can do most things from their cars. There are drive-in banks, post offices, restaurants, movie theatres and even some churches.In Britain the proportion of the population who are drivers is slightly less but, as in the US, many people prefer to use their car rather than public transport, because it is more convenient and because they like to be independent. In order to reduce pollution the government tries to discourage car ownership by making driving expensive. In particular, it puts a heavy tax on petrol and increases the annual road tax for cars that cause heavy pollution. Congestion charging is used to persuade people to avoid driving their cars in city centres.To many people the make and quality of their car reflects their status in society, and it is important to them to get a smart new car every few years. In Britain since 2001 the registration number of a car shows the place and date of registration but older number plates can be used and a personalized number plate (= a registration number that spells out the owner\u2019s name or initials) may also suggest status. Many people prefer to buy a small, economical car, or get a second-hand one. Cars in the US are often larger than those in Britain and though petrol\/gas is cheaper, insurance is expensive. In the US car license plates, commonly called tags, are given by the states. New ones must be bought every two or three years, or when a driver moves to another state. The states use the plates to advertise themselves: Alabama plates say \u2018The heart of Dixie\u2019 and have a small heart on them, and Illinois has \u2018The land of Lincoln\u2019.In Britain, before a person can get a driving licence they must pass an official driving test, which includes a written test of the  Highway Code and a practical driving exam. Only people aged 17 or over are allowed to drive. Learner drivers who have a provisional driving licence must display an L-plate, a large red \u2018L\u2019, on their car, and be supervised by a qualified driver. The US has no national driver\u2019s license (AmE), but instead licences are issued by each state. Most require written tests, an eye test and a short practical test. The minimum age for getting a licence is normally 16, although some states will issue a learner\u2019s permit to drivers as young as 14. Many states now apply a system of graduated licenses in which young drivers are first required to have an intermediate license for a period of time before being given a full license. An intermediate licence may, for example, prevent driving alone at particular times of the day or require the driver to take special classes if they drive badly. Americans have to get a new driver\u2019s licence if they move to another state.In Britain people drive on the left and in the US they drive on the right. Generally British and US drivers are relatively careful and courteous but there is dangerous driving. In the US many of the deaths due to traffic accidents are caused by drivers who have drunk alcohol. Drink-driving (AmE driving under the influence or driving while intoxicated) (= driving a car after drinking alcohol) is also a serious problem in Britain. On many British roads speed cameras have been set up to catch drivers who go too fast. In the US the main job of state highway patrols is to prevent speeding.Many drivers belong to a motoring organization in case their car breaks down. In Britain the main ones are the AA (Automobile Association) and the RAC (Royal Automobile Club), and in the US the largest is the American Automobile Association.","17295":"an amount of food or drink that you put in your mouth at one time","26114":"a fully grown male horse, especially one that is used for breeding","21047":"a soft substance that is made by crushing wood, cloth or other material and then used to make paper","2388":"GM crops: for","25001":"having doubts that a claim or statement is true or that sth will happen","29447":"especially of clothing","15992":"one of a set of narrow strips of wood, plastic, etc. in a door or a window that are designed to let air and some light in, but to keep out strong light or rain; a door or a window that has these strips across it","5797":"the process of becoming smaller","29569":"in danger of being harmed","23506":"something unpleasant or ugly that spoils the appearance or public image of sth","4506":"a show performed by circus entertainers, usually in a large tent called a big top","10242":"wider at the bottom edge than at the top","28648":"to move your head suddenly upwards, especially to show that you are annoyed or impatient","7289":"to make sb decide not to do sth or continue doing sth, especially by making them understand the difficulties and unpleasant results of their actions","12088":"a country consisting of the island of Grenada and a group of smaller islands in the Caribbean.

In the 11th century, tribes living in Scotland divided into small clans that settled round lochs (= lakes) and glens (= valleys), and on the islands. Among the most powerful were the Campbells and the MacGregors of Argyll, the MacLeods and the MacDonalds of the Western Isles, the MacKays of Caithness and the Stewarts of Appin. The chief of each clan had complete authority. Clansmen were known by the name of their father, and this was shown by the prefix Mac- added to the father\u2019s name. Many Scottish surnames begin with Mac-. Clan membership did not in fact depend on sharing the same name, and many clan members were not related to the chief, but were admitted to the clan as loyal supporters.The clans often fought one another. The most famous argument was between the Campbells and the MacDonalds. After William III became king in 1688, many clans joined the Jacobites who supported the former Roman Catholic king, James II. When William ordered all the clans to swear allegiance (= swear that they would be loyal) to himself, the MacDonalds of Glencoe failed to do so. The Campbells were sent to punish them, resulting in the Massacre of Glencoe (1692), in which many MacDonalds were murdered.The clans fought together with the Jacobites against the English in 1715 and again, under Bonny Prince Charlie, in 1745, but they were finally defeated at the Battle of Culloden (1746). Many clansmen were killed or put in prison. Shortly afterwards, the Highland Clearances, in which the crofts (= small farms) of many Scots were destroyed by the landowners to make way for sheep farming, further reduced the influence of the clans.After Culloden, the clans were forbidden to wear  tartan because it was thought to be a symbol of the desire for an independent Scotland. A tartan kilt (= man\u2019s knee-length pleated skirt) was an important part of a clansman\u2019s traditional clothing, but individual tartan patterns were not associated with a particular clan until Victorian times. Today, Scotsmen generally only wear kilts on special occasions.Clans are still important in Scotland, especially in the Highlands. Many people outside Scotland, especially in the US, also take pride in having Scottish ancestors and being members of a clan.","14898":"a country ruled by a king or queen","1891":"to rub the skin off your knee, etc. by falling or by knocking against sth","14508":"to lift sth, especially a vehicle, off the ground using a jack","2006":"Britain and the US follow the Gregorian calendar, which replaced the Roman Julian calendar in 1752. The year is divided into 12 months, with 30 or 31 days in each month, except February, which has 28 days. An extra day is added to February every fourth year, called a leap year, to keep the calendar in time with the moon. A well-known verse helps people remember how many days there are in each month:Thirty days hath September,April, June and November.All the rest have thirty-one,Excepting February alone,Which hath twenty-eight days clear,and twenty-nine in each leap year.The calendar year starts on 1 January, New Year\u2019s Day. The number of each year (2003, 2004, etc.\u2009) represents the number of years that have passed since the birth of Jesus Christ. The year 2000 marked the end of the second millennium (= a period of 1\u2009000 years) since Christ was born. The years before Christ are described as BC (= before Christ), e.g. 55 BC, or BCE (= before the Common Era). The abbreviations AD (Latin Anno Domini, meaning \u2018in the year of the Lord\u2019) or CE (= Common Era) are put before or after the date for the years after Christ\u2019s birth, e.g. AD 44 or 44 AD, but they are not used with years after about 200 AD. Some cultural and religious groups use different calendars: the year 2000 in the Gregorian calendar began during the year 5760 in the Jewish calendar, 1420 in the Islamic calendar and 1921 in the Hindu calendar.The academic year used by schools and colleges in Britain runs from September to July, with short holidays at Christmas and in the spring and a long summer vacation. In the US the academic year runs from August or September to May or June. Many business companies have a financial year (= a period of accounting) that runs from April to the following March. The tax year in the US is the same as the calendar year but the tax year in Britain begins on 5 April. The reason is that in medieval times the calendar year began on 25 March, not 1 January. When the Gregorian Calendar was introduced, an adjustment was needed and 11 days were removed from September 1752. To avoid being accused of collecting a full year\u2019s taxes in a short year, the government extended the end of the tax year 1752\u20133 to 4 April.Many festivals are celebrated during the year. Christmas and Easter are the main Christian festivals. Jews remember Passover and Yom Kippur. Ramadan, a month of fasting, and Eid ul-Fitr are celebrated by Muslims. Diwali, the Hindu festival of light, takes place in October or November, and the Chinese celebrate their new year in January or February. Special occasions such as Bonfire Night in Britain and Thanksgiving in the US are enjoyed by almost everyone.","25319":"a small soft creature with a hard round shell on its back, that moves very slowly and often eats garden plants.

Projects paid for by aid money are often aimed at improving local housing and water supply, agriculture, health and education. Training local people is a central part of many programmes. A lot of aid money comes from governments, but development projects are often run with the help of non-governmental organizations (NGOs), such as charities. Some charities, e.g. Oxfam, the Red Cross and the Save the Children Fund, run their own aid programmes with money given by the general public. Additional emergency aid is given after natural disasters.The British government gives aid each year to developing countries, especially those which belong to the Commonwealth. Some aid is given direct to individual countries; the rest is distributed through international organizations such as the European Union, the United Nations and the World Bank. Britain, together with other countries, is helping to reduce the debts of poorer countries and may under certain circumstances cancel debts from Commonwealth countries.The US began giving foreign aid during the Second World War, when the Lend-Lease Act made it possible to give military equipment to foreign countries. After the war the US created the Marshall Plan, a $15 billion programme to help European countries rebuild their economies. The US has continued to spend large amounts of money on foreign aid, but has been criticized for the way it decides who to help. In general, money goes to poor countries that are important to the US for commercial or military reasons. Formerly, the US gave money to countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America so that they would not accept money from the Soviet Union.  USAID distributes US foreign aid.Two organizations are particularly concerned with training local people. In Britain  Voluntary Service Overseas arranges for skilled people to work abroad for a few years so that they can pass on their skills. They are paid at local rates by the government of the country they are working in. The  Peace Corps, a US government agency, does similar work but pays volunteers living expenses and gives them a small allowance.","20023":"the mortar that is put in the spaces between the bricks or stones in a wall; the method of filling in the spaces with mortar","17026":"having qualities that people do not see or fully understand","533":"connected with farming and the use of land for farming","26367":"a large decorated cup for drinking beer, usually made of earthenware and often with a lid","27850":"of a climate or region","14892":"used to ask or tell sb to do sth, especially when you are annoyed","27189":"used in or connected with surgery","29648":"that can be used; in good enough condition to be used","2708":"a country in central South America","973":"the tools or other pieces of equipment that are needed for a particular activity or task","21839":"to find an acceptable way of dealing with two or more ideas, needs, etc. that seem to be opposed to each other","30390":"a small wild animal with reddish-brown fur, a long thin body and short legs.

A statutory company is set up by an Act of Parliament. Many former statutory companies that were managed by the government, such as those responsible for Britain\u2019s railway system and coal industry, have now been privatized (= sold and made into privately-run companies operating for profit), because these are thought to be more efficient.Most commercial businesses in Britain are registered companies. Lists of these are kept by the Registrar of Companies, and company information and accounts are kept at Companies House. Registered companies may be either private companies or public companies. Private companies have a limited number of shareholders (or members), and their shares are not available to the general public. Shares in public companies can be bought and sold by the public on the stock exchange.A limited company, sometimes called a limited liability company, can be either private or public. The liability (= responsibility) of shareholders for any losses is limited to the value of their shares. Private limited companies have the letters Ltd after their name. A public limited company (plc) must offer its shares for sale to the public. Most large companies in Britain, such as BT and Marks & Spencer, are public limited companies. A special type of limited company, the company limited by guarantee, is used especially for charities. Rather than buy shares, its members promise to pay for a share of debts if it fails.Most businesses in the US are corporations, which are similar to British limited companies. People who invest money in them are liable for (= risk losing) only the amount they have invested. Some corporations sell their shares on the stock exchange, but others do not. Small corporations, e.g. family businesses, may be called close corporations. Corporations often have the letters inc. (short for \u2018incorporated\u2019) after their name. The laws about how corporations are formed and should operate vary from state to state.In both Britain and the US, professional businesses like law firmsare often partnerships, which consist of two or more people who own a business and are together responsible for its debts. In a limited partnership \u2018general partners\u2019 run the business and take responsibility for debts while \u2018limited partners\u2019 only invest money.A sole proprietorship is run by one person only. Many small businesses in the US operate in this way because the rules are much simpler than those for corporations. Sole proprietorships do not have limited liability. If the name of the business is not the same as the name of the person who runs it, the letters d.b.a. are used, short for doing business as, e.g. Ted Smith, d.b.a.

Traditionally, women change their surname when they marry, replacing their maiden name, the surname they had from birth, with the surname of their husband. In the US especially, some women keep their maiden name as a middle name. Others choose to keep their maiden name as their surname after they are married. A few create a double-barrelled name (AmE hyphenated name) from the two surnames, such as Johnson-Brown. In a few cases the husband and children may also take this name. In Britain a double-barrelled surname used to suggest an upper-class background, but this is no longer always so.In the US, laws about changing a last name, whether after marriage or for some other reason, vary from state to state, but it is usually a simple process and in some states people can just begin to use a new name if they want to. In Britain a woman can change her surname automatically after marriage. If people wish to change their name for any other reason they can do so by deed poll, a simple legal procedure.In fact people rarely change their surname except after marriage, and many people are able to research their family history over many centuries. Most families were known by surnames by 1300 and many of the old names are still common. Sometimes the names reflected the place where the family lived, such as the name of their village or a reference to a feature of the local countryside, e.g. Ford, Hill or Wood. Other surnames refer to the original occupation or trade of the family, e.g. Baker, Miller, Shepherd and Smith. Sometimes the surname began as a nickname. For instance, someone with dark hair or dark skin might be called Black, Blake or Brown. Some surnames were taken from personal names, as in Andrews, Martin and Roberts. Others were based on French names that came to Britain during the Norman Conquest, e.g. Sinclair from the French \u2018Saint-Clair\u2019.Many surnames occur throughout Britain, but others suggest a particular regional origin. Many Scottish names begin with Mc- or Mac-, meaning \u201ason of\u2019, e.g. McDonald and MacGregor. Members of a clan added this prefix to their father\u2019s name. Irish surnames often begin with O\u2019, meaning \u201adescended from\u2019, e.g. O\u2019Brien. Many Irish surnames are derived from ancient Celtic names. Common Welsh surnames include Evans, Morgan, Price, Rees and Williams. The most common surname in England and Scotland is Smith, closely followed by Jones, a name also widely found in Wales. Other surnames were brought to Britain by families from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and China. These include Ahmed, Hussain, Khan, Patel, Singh and Tsang.All the surnames found in Britain are also found in the US, together with many others from all over the world. Some people wanted to sound more American when they arrived in the US and so took English last names. Sometimes government officials could not understand the names of new arrivals and wrote similar English names on their documents. Many Americans of German origin changed their names during the two world wars. African Americans whose ancestors were slaves do not know what last names their families originally had. Many have English or Irish names, because slaves had to take the names of their owners.When British and American people introduce themselves they give their first name and then their surname, e.g. Michael Johnson, Linda Johnson. The opposite order \u201aJohnson, Michael\u2019 is used only in alphabetical lists. In informal situations people often give only their first name. When people are addressed formally a title is put before their last name, usually Mr for men and Mrs, Miss or Ms for women. Married women used always to be called Mrs Johnson, etc. Unmarried women were known as Miss Johnson, etc. Many women now prefer the title Ms because, like Mr, it does not give any information about whether the person is married. Other titles include Dr for medical doctors and people with a doctorateand General, Colonel, etc. for people holding military ranks. People can be addressed as Dr Jones, Professor Roberts etc. or simply as Doctor (for a medical doctor) and Professor. Men especially may be referred to simply by their last name, e.g. the previous president was Clinton, but addressing somebody in this way can seem old-fashioned or may cause offence.","23901":"according to what you have read or heard","2935":"to make sth stronger or more solid by supporting it with sth","25578":"all the music, speech and sounds that are recorded for a film\/movie","24625":"an event that presents sb's abilities or the good qualities of sth in an attractive way","20444":"at the time you are speaking or writing; now","15590":"the feeling that you like sb\/sth; the enjoyment of sth","23501":"a device for examining sth or recording sth using light, sound or X-rays","24753":"to surround a building, especially in order to speak to or question the person or people living or working there","21877":"the fact of people doing things for enjoyment, when they are not working","2510":"of a situation","17834":"people of high social position who have titles such as that of duke or duchess","15136":"to become attached to sb\/sth","22598":"the process of sth becoming or being made popular or fashionable again","21558":"to say sth suddenly and quickly in a loud, angry way","20215":"connected with the official system for sending and delivering letters, etc","7559":"a club or party where people dance to recorded pop music","12290":"to swallow large amounts of food or drink quickly","3471":"a strong pronunciation of the \u2018r\u2019 sound, typical of some accents in English; an accent with this type of pronunciation","921":"the state of being very old or ancient","9642":"the act of saying goodbye to sb","7394":"to be the particular thing that shows that things or people are not the same","8827":"a large project, especially one that is difficult  venture","26097":"something that is stale has been said or done too many times before and is no longer interesting or exciting","23744":"to close a container tightly or fill a crack, etc, especially so that air, liquid, etc. cannot get in or out","10142":"a hand when it is tightly closed with the fingers bent into the palm","10763":"very evil or cruel","7952":" The Downs is the general name for a number of ranges of low chalk hills, covered with grass but no trees, in southern England.

The year is divided into 12 months, with 30 or 31 days in each month, except February, which has 28 days. An extra day is added to February every fourth year, called a leap year, to keep the calendar in time with the moon. A well-known verse helps people remember how many days there are in each month:Thirty days hath September,April, June and November.All the rest have thirty-one,Excepting February alone,Which hath twenty-eight days clear,and twenty-nine in each leap year.The calendar year starts on 1 January, New Year\u2019s Day. The number of each year (2003, 2004, etc.\u2009) represents the number of years that have passed since the birth of Jesus Christ. The year 2000 marked the end of the second millennium (= a period of 1\u2009000 years) since Christ was born. The years before Christ are described as BC (= before Christ), e.g. 55 BC, or BCE (= before the Common Era). The abbreviations AD (Latin Anno Domini, meaning \u2018in the year of the Lord\u2019) or CE (= Common Era) are put before or after the date for the years after Christ\u2019s birth, e.g. AD 44 or 44 AD, but they are not used with years after about 200 AD. Some cultural and religious groups use different calendars: the year 2000 in the Gregorian calendar began during the year 5760 in the Jewish calendar, 1420 in the Islamic calendar and 1921 in the Hindu calendar.The academic year used by schools and colleges in Britain runs from September to July, with short holidays at Christmas and in the spring and a long summer vacation. In the US the academic year runs from August or September to May or June. Many business companies have a financial year (= a period of accounting) that runs from April to the following March. The tax year in the US is the same as the calendar year but the tax year in Britain begins on 5 April. The reason is that in medieval times the calendar year began on 25 March, not 1 January. When the Gregorian Calendar was introduced, an adjustment was needed and 11 days were removed from September 1752. To avoid being accused of collecting a full year\u2019s taxes in a short year, the government extended the end of the tax year 1752\u20133 to 4 April.Many festivals are celebrated during the year. Christmas and Easter are the main Christian festivals. Jews remember Passover and Yom Kippur. Ramadan, a month of fasting, and Eid ul-Fitr are celebrated by Muslims. Diwali, the Hindu festival of light, takes place in October or November, and the Chinese celebrate their new year in January or February.

Seaside towns such as Brighton, Lyme Regis and Scarborough became fashionable with the upper class. Bathing in the sea became popular and bathing machines were invented for people to get changed in. Later, towns like Blackpool, Clacton-on-Sea and Margate, which were close to industrial areas or to London, developed into large seaside resorts to which workers went for a day out or for their holiday. Long piers were built stretching out to sea and soon had a wide range of amusements built on them. Promenades were built along the shore for people to walk along. Rows of beach huts and chalets (= buildings where people could get changed or sit and have tea) took the place of bathing machines, and deckchairs were for hire on the beach. There were ice-cream sellers, whelk stalls, stalls selling buckets and spades for children to build sandcastles, and the occasional Punch and Judy show. In the early 1900s it became popular to send seaside postcards to friends. Children bought seaside rock, a long sugary sweet with the name of the place printed through it.Most British people like to go to the sea for a day out or for a weekend. Resorts like Blackpool are still popular, but others are run-down and rather quiet. British people now prefer to go on holiday to beach resorts in Spain, Greece or the Caribbean because the weather is more likely to be sunny and warm.Americans talk of going to the ocean or the beach, rather than the seaside. Some places, especially on the East coast, have very popular beaches and people travel long distances to go there. Florida is especially popular and at spring break (= a holiday in the spring for high school and college students) it is full of students.Beach activities include swimming, surfing and windsurfing, also called sailboarding. Many people go to the beach but never go into the water. They spend their time playing games like volleyball (= hitting a large ball backwards and forwards over a net) and Frisbee (= throwing a flat plastic disc). Other people go to the beach to get a tan and spend all their time sunbathing. Many people worry about getting skin cancer if they get burnt by the sun and so put on sun cream or sun block to protect their skin. A day at the beach often also involves a picnic meal or, especially in the US, a barbecue (= meat cooked over an open fire).","26665":"too anxious and tired to be able to relax","29771":"made in the shape of an arch or a series of arches; having a ceiling or roof of this shape","19618":"to cost a person or an organization a lot of money or more than they can spend","30715":"a county in south-west England.

They may be new, or existing words used in a new sense and context. As time goes by, some are used more widely and are no longer thought of as slang. Clever and naughty, for instance, were both formerly slang words that are now accepted as standard. Many slang words die out after a few years or sooner. The regular introduction of new words to replace them helps keep the language alive.A lot of slang words are restricted to a particular social group. Use of slang suggests an easy, informal relationship between people and helps reinforce social identity. In the 18th century the word slang described the language of criminals, but since then every group in society has developed its own slang terms. The groups that use most slang are still those closest to the edge of society: criminals, prisoners and drug users. Young people also develop slang expressions to distance themselves from older people.The street language of young people changes fast. Street slang includes words relating to young people\u2019s attitudes. Young people today may describe something exciting as cool, massive, wicked, or (especially in AmE) bad or phat. If something is old-fashioned or undesirable it is naff. Anything bad is rank or minging. A geek, prat, anorak, nerd or (especially in AmE) dweeb is somebody who seems rather stupid. Going out and having a good time is chilling. As people get older they sometimes keep on using the same slang words and in this way slang may indicate a person\u2019s age. The parents of today\u2019s young people used great, super, fab, swinging, square or berk and clot, when they were young, and many of them still use these words. Some older people try to use current street slang in order not to seem old-fashioned, though in many cases it sounds odd and inappropriate.A lot of street slang refers to drink, drugs and sex. Many of these words and phrases are not socially acceptable and are widely considered rude and offensive. The expressions pissed, hammered and rat-arsed relate to being drunk. There are many expressions for vomitingafter drinking too much, e.g. blowing chunks, chundering or (AmE) praying to the porcelain god. Slang words for drugs include smack (heroin) and crack (cocaine). Expressions connected with drug-taking include chasing the dragon (= smoking heroin in tinfoil) and jacking\/banging up (= injecting drugs). Some of these terms have become more widely known through films like  Trainspotting. Shagging, screwing and getting your leg over all refer to sex. Other common slang expressions refer to the body\u2019s waste functions, e.g. piss, take a leak, have a shit and take a dump. Some words, such as fuck and shit, have become frequently used swear words but they are still likely to offend many people.Slang words are also widely used for things found in everyday life. The television, for instance, can be called the box and the remote controlthe flicker or zapper. The blower or the horn is the telephone. A dive or a hole is a cheap restaurant, bar or nightclub. Money can be referred to as dough, dosh, dollars (whatever the currency) or moolah.Some slang expressions are euphemisms. Many older people use euphemisms for bodily functions, e.g. spend a penny, powder your nose, and visit the bathroom. Some common serious diseases have slang names which are lighter in tone than the formal name, e.g. the big C for cancer. Somebody with a bad heart has a dicky ticker. People use expressions like pass away, kick the bucket or pop your clogs to refer to dying. In business, some companies, instead of sacking or firing an employee, may speak of letting them go or (AmE) dehiring them.Some professions and areas of work have their own terms, often called jargon, which are different from slang. Many people learn bits of the jargon of other groups through television programmes and films about hospitals, law courts, prisons, etc. Some of the jargon used by people who work with computers has also become well known. Most people know, for instance, that a hacker is somebody who gets into other people\u2019s computer systems without permission.","26950":"of a person or their behaviour","25205":"(a person) from Slovenia","5771":"continuing without interruption","25055":"not stretched tight","10325":"a quick look through the pages of a book, magazine, etc.","27084":"of a wound or damage","1821":"a country which was part of Pakistan until it became an independent member of the Commonwealth in 1971.

The houses are called stately homes from the opening lines of a poem by Felicia Hemans (1793\u20131835). They are sometimes also called country houses because most of them are in the countryside. Some are approached through large iron gates down a long drive. Many have formal gardens and are surrounded by a large private park, often with a lake.Stately homes range from small manor houses to palaces. Manor houses date from the 14th century and are often square stone buildings with a central courtyard, and some are entered by crossing a moatwhich was originally a means of defence. Some larger houses were built in the 16th century, including Hampton Court in south-west London, Burghley House near Peterborough and Hardwick Hall near Derby.Many stately homes date from the 18th century, and are associated with famous architects. Blenheim Palace near Oxford was designed in the baroque style by Vanbrugh and Hawksmoor. Holkham Hall in Norfolk, designed only a few years later by William Kent, is in the Palladian style. Kedleston Hall near Derby, the home of the Curzon family, was mainly the work of Robert Adam. The large estates attached to stately homes attracted landscape gardeners such as \u2018Capability\u2019 Brown, who laid out the gardens at Burghley, Blenheim and Chatsworth.Stately homes are very expensive to look after and, in order to get enough money to do this, some owners open their houses to the public. They charge visitors an admission fee. Many stately homes have been given by their owners to the National Trust, an organization which raises the money to look after them from gifts, membership fees and admission charges. In many cases, the former owners continue to live in part of the house. This arrangement means that the house is well cared for, and the family does not have to pay inheritance tax when the owner dies.Visitors go to stately homes to admire their architecture, and to walk round the gardens. They also go to see valuable furniture, paintings, tapestries and china that have been collected over a long period.

The upper class consists mainly of members of the aristocracy. The most senior are the  royal family and members of the  peerage. Next below them are  baronets. Baronets have hereditary titles (= ranks passed on in the family from one generation to the next) but, unlike some peers, are not allowed to sit in the House of Lords. Below this there are various orders of knighthood.  Knights are appointed by the king or queen. In medieval times soldiers were made knights in recognition of military service for their local lord. Today, knighthoods and other honours are announced at New Year or on the king\u2019s or queen\u2019s birthday and are given in recognition of distinguished public service or achievement. New knights receive their title at a special ceremony, during which they kneel before the king or queen, who taps them once on each shoulder with a sword. Knights may put Sir (for men) or Dame (for women) before their first name, and are allowed to have their own coat of arms (= a family symbol, usually a design on a shield).The oldest order of knighthood in England, which is also the oldest order of chivalry in Europe, is the  Order of the Garter. There are 25 Knights of the Garter, in addition to the king or queen and the Prince of Wales. Other senior orders of knighthood include the Order of the Thistle, the Order of the Bath, the Order of the British Empire and the Royal Victorian Order. Letters after a person\u2019s name indicate which order he or she belongs to. Other knights are known as knights bachelor.People who have an upper-class family background may be considered as part of the local aristocracy even if they do not have a title. They often have an upper-class accent and Conservative social and political views and are referred to as the county set. Members of the aristocracy are sometimes described as \u201ablue-blooded\u2019, because in former times their veins showed blue through their skin which was pale from not having to work in the fields. They are also referred to informally as \u201athe upper crust\u2019, or more rudely as \u201atoffs\u2019. Formerly, members of the aristocracy could command respect because of their noble birth. Nowadays, people are much more critical of those who inherit honours but who from their behaviour do not appear to deserve them.The US has no formal aristocracy in that there are no families who have been given titles by the head of state. In fact, the Constitution forbids an aristocracy, saying \u201aNo title of nobility shall be granted by the United States.\u2019 Perhaps because of this, Americans are very interested in Britain\u2019s royal family and nobility. There is, however, respect for US families who, though they do not have titles, have wealth and a social position similar to the British aristocracy. Class in the US is, to a large extent, based on money, but some people have more respect for old money (= money, land, etc. that has belonged to a family for many years) than new money (= money that a person has earned by working). The  Boston Brahmins are the old, traditional families of Boston and they, together with groups of old families from other parts of the US, make up a type of American aristocracy.","6591":"to make the effect of a fall or hit less severe","763":"a gas with a strong smell; a clear liquid containing ammonia, used as a cleaning substance","14293":"frightening in a way which makes a person feel less confident","1987":"old, used a lot, and not in very good condition","13228":"having or wearing a hood","28550":"to accept sb\/sth that is annoying, unpleasant, etc. without complaining","8343":"of a person","1590":"feelings of respect and slight fear; feelings of being very impressed by sth\/sb","8382":"to become or to make sth less unpleasant, painful, severe, etc.","27472":"a small piece of paper, cloth, metal, etc. that sticks out from the edge of sth, and that is used to give information about it, or to hold it, fasten it, etc","22249":"the fact of doing or saying the same thing many times","30749":"either of the attacking players who play towards the side of the playing area in sports such as football ( soccer ) or hockey","21059":"of a liquid","4874":"a thin layer of a substance covering a surface","12672":"of a person","5254":"a thing that is useful or has a useful quality","4367":"having no children","23632":"to search an area or various areas in order to find or discover sth","7891":"on or connected with the back of a fish or an animal","29448":"especially of work","6101":"a person or company whose job is to take packages or important papers somewhere","18982":"the act or result of dividing sth into parts","781":"of a person's figure","19238":" Peers of the realm are people who hold the highest ranks in the British  aristocracy. As a group, they are sometimes referred to as the peerage. There are two main types of peers: hereditary peers hold titles that are passed from one generation to the next, while life peers have a personal title which lasts for their own lifetime but is not passed on to their children.The peerage is divided into five main ranks. The most senior rank is that of duke (for a man) or duchess (for a woman), a hereditary title which was created in Norman times. There are five royal Dukes, including the Duke of Edinburgh, and 24 other dukes. The second most senior rank is that of marquess (man) or marchioness (woman), of which there are under 40. The third rank is that of earl (man) or countess (woman), of which there are nearly 200. This is the oldest title of all. Next in rank is a viscount (man) or viscountess (woman). The fifth and lowest rank of the peerage is that of baron (man) or baroness (woman), of which there are around 500 with hereditary titles. At present, about two thirds of all peers hold hereditary titles, many of which were originally given by the reigning king or queen to close friends or in return for some service. Senior titles often include the name of the place where the family comes from, e.g. the Duke of Devonshire, the Marquess of Normanby. A woman may be a duchess, marchioness, etc. in her own right or receive the title when she marries a duke, etc.Life peers include the Lords of Appeal in Ordinary, usually referred to as  Law Lords, who are the most senior judges in the land, the  Lords Spiritual, who are the archbishops of Canterbury and York and 24 bishops of the Church of England and, since 1958, many other men and women who have been given a peerage in recognition of their public service. Most of these are given the rank of baron or baroness.There are complicated rules for how to address and refer to members of the peerage. Dukes, for instance, are addressed formally as \u201aYour Grace\u2019, marquesses and earls as \u201aMy Lord\u2019, and viscounts and barons as \u201aLord X \u2019. There are also rules for addressing members of their families. Most British people know that such complicated forms of address exist but many would not be able to use them correctly, and would probably think that they are rather strange and old-fashioned.Peers cannot be elected to the House of Commons as Members of Parliament unless they have first disclaimed their title. Tony Benn campaigned for members of the peerage to have this right and was himself the first to be able to give up his title and become an MP. Former members of the House of Commons who have been elevated to the peerage as a reward for their service are sometimes said to have been \u201akicked upstairs\u2019.At present, all life peers and some hereditary peers may take part in the government of Britain by taking their seat in the House of Lords, though many do not attend regularly. When a Labour government was elected in 1997 it stated that it would abolish the hereditary peerage and reform the Upper House.

Freemasonry, or Masonry, developed in Britain from medieval guilds (= trade associations) of masons (= craftsmen) who travelled round the country. There was a guild for each craft. Its members were highly skilled master craftsmen and journeymen (= trained workers). Titles given to modern Masons reflect these origins. New members are admitted as apprentices and may go on to the higher rank of fellowcraft or journeyman, and finally master mason. Tools traditionally used by stonemasonsare still used in the society\u2019s ceremonies.During the 17th century the guilds became popular with rich gentlemen who gradually took them over. They developed into secret societies whose religious beliefs and practices provoked the hostility of many, including the Roman Catholic Church. In 1717 the Grand Lodge was founded in London and became the most important branch of the society with authority over other branches or lodges. The Grand Lodge of Scotland was founded in 1736.Most Masons today belong to the professional and middle classes and are lawyers, civil servants, businessmen, etc, though members of the aristocracy and the royal family have also been Masons. In Britain, new members are only admitted at the invitation of existing Masons and have to go through a special initiation ceremony in which they promise not to tell anyone else the secrets of the society. It is commonly believed that they also learn special signs and words, and the Masons\u2019 handshake, which they can use in public to identify themselves to other Masons. In the US some of the details of Masonic practices are different: for example, people who wish to become Masons must ask to join, because Masons are not allowed to invite others to become Masons.In Britain, because Masons keep their affairs secret, Freemasonry has often been viewed with suspicion. Many people believe that Masons in positions of power give other members of the society an unfair advantage. Masons themselves deny such practices and emphasize the social and charitable aspects of the movement. In the US there is a more tolerant attitude to Freemasonry. Perhaps the best known Freemasons in the US are a group called Shriners. Shriners are well known for their circuses which are held every year to raise money for charity work, including hospitals that the Shriners run.Many other social clubs in the US which call themselves fraternal organizations have titles and ceremonies that are based on those of the Masons.","10561":"made to feel or look silly and embarrassed","8374":"the profit that a company makes","8572":"having both electrical and magnetic characteristics (or properties )","22660":"late Old English","24662":"a shaking movement you make because you are cold, frightened or disgusted","17352":"a person who is stupid and easy to trick","4610":"of information","13871":"a sign that a system, society, etc. is very bad or very wrong","19228":"to be just visible","2439":"very strange or unusual","15657":"in American football","14626":"a person who treats a friend badly by not being loyal","12104":"in motor racing","7889":"not active or growing now but able to become active or to grow in the future","21604":"to talk or write about sth in a very enthusiastic way","8312":"likely to last for a long time without breaking or getting weaker","19528":"a vehicle with low sides and no roof at the back used, for example, by farmers","29339":"the largest of the eight branches of the University of California.

For many Americans it is the most important holiday apart from Christmas. Schools, offices and most businesses close for Thanksgiving, and many people make the whole weekend a vacation.Thanksgiving is associated with the time when Europeans first came to North America. In 1620 the ship the  Mayflower arrived, bringing about 150 people who today are usually called  Pilgrims. They arrived at the beginning of a very hard winter and could not find enough to eat, so many of them died. But in the following summer Native Americans showed them what foods were safe to eat, so that they could save food for the next winter. They held a big celebration to thank God and the Native Americans for the fact that they had survived.Today people celebrate Thanksgiving to remember these early days. The most important part of the celebration is a traditional dinner with foods that come from North America. The meal includes turkey, sweet potatoes or yams, and cranberries, which are made into a kind of sauce or jelly. The turkey is filled with stuffing or dressing, and many families have their own special recipe. Dessert is pumpkin made into a pie.On Thanksgiving there are special television programmes and sports events. In New York there is the  Macy\u2019s Thanksgiving Day Parade, when a long line of people wearing fancy costumes march through the streets with large balloons in the shape of imaginary characters. Thanksgiving is considered the beginning of the Christmas period, and the next day many people go out to shop for Christmas presents.","2703":"a container in which water is heated to provide hot water and heating in a building or to produce steam in an engine","2982":"a break in a relationship between people or countries","27149":"to prevent sth from growing, developing or continuing","25312":"Making and receiving phone calls","4704":"the space between a woman's breasts that can be seen above a dress that does not completely cover them","758":"a popular national song in the US, first sung in 1831.

Many of them celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ.Carols were first sung in the 14th century. They were popular songs with a lively tune, and contained references to the celebrations and feeling of goodwill associated with Christmas, as well as to Christ\u2019s birth. One of the oldest printed carols, dating from 1521, is the Boar\u2019s Head Carol, which was sung in Queen\u2019s College, Oxford as Christmas lunch was carried in. Other traditional carols that are thought to have originated at this time include  God Rest You Merry, Gentlemen and  While Shepherds Watched Their Flocks by Night.In England during the 16th century, the Puritans tried to stop people singing carols, but the words continued to be handed downfrom one generation to the next. In the 19th century many of these carols were collected and printed. Some tunes were taken from folk songs, others were specially written. Many of the most popular carols heard today date from this time. They include  O Come, All Ye Faithful,  Hark! the Herald Angels Sing,  Good King Wenceslas,  Away in a Manger and  O Little Town of Bethlehem.Traditional carols are very popular in Britain and America, but children also like more modern songs, such as  Rudolph, the Red-nosed Reindeer, about how a reindeer\u2019s bright red nose lights the way for Santa Claus to take toys to children during a storm, and Frosty the Snowman, which tells the story of a figure made of snow who comes to life.In the 19th century groups of carol singers, called waits, used to gather in the streets to play and sing for local people, who thanked them by offering drinks or mince pies (= small round pies containing dried fruit, apples and sugar). This custom became known as wassailing and still continues in Britain, with people meeting to sing carols in most town and village centres. Any money that is collected is given to charity. Some singers walk from street to street, singing carols outside each house. In the US door-to-door carol singing is not common, except in a few small communities. Families sing carols when they decorate the Christmas tree.Carols are also sung in churches and, in Britain, in schools, in special Christmas services. One of the most famous carol services is the Festival of Nine Lessons and Carols, which is performed at King\u2019s College, Cambridge, and broadcast on BBC radio on Christmas Eve.","25297":"having the colour or appearance of smoke","6452":"to break sth into small pieces or into a powder by pressing hard","31107":"used to show position, for example on a map","10815":"the right to vote in a country's elections","1133":"with nothing new or interesting in it","10358":"a small quick hit with a part of the body that causes sth to turn over","10354":"to turn onto the other side or upside down","4556":"done secretly or kept secret","26076":"to damage the opinion that people have of sth","476":"of or connected with Africa","16872":"the time when one period of 1\u2009000 years ends and another begins","16959":"consisting of many different kinds of things that are not connected and do not easily form a group","25838":"of a group of people","22822":"a type of loud popular music, developed in the 1960s, with a strong beat played on electric guitars and drums","677":"the flat pale sweet nut of the almond tree used in cooking and to make almond oil","8310":"to do sth again, especially when it is unnecessary","16706":"a thing that will continue to remind people of sb\/sth","30738":"a place where wine is made","22619":"a piece of music that is full of feeling and is not regular in form","20155":"from or connected with Portugal","31048":"a sport in which two people fight by holding each other and trying to throw or force the other one to the ground","5989":"a change that makes sth more accurate than it was before","2339":"using two languages; written in two languages","28392":"to cover a surface with tiles","29960":"how far or well you can see, especially as affected by the light or the weather","29855":"to stop sth from happening or being done by using your official authority (= by using your veto )","8911":"in a vertical position  straight","14505":"to connect to a computer system","22933":"developing from or being strongly influenced by sth","21653":"showing a reaction or response","8063":"to be very afraid of sth; to fear that sth bad is going to happen","21472":"having or bringing a lot of rain","20696":"doing or achieving a lot","6403":"the part of the body where the legs join at the top, including the area around the genitals","23299":"without any possibility of the situation changing","7737":"making you feel anxious and upset or shocked","19151":"the surface of a road","6347":"a game played on grass by two teams of 11 players.

Some have it delivered to their home by a paper boy or paper girl; others buy it from a newsagent (= a shop that sells newspapers, magazines, sweets, etc.) or a bookstall. Some people read a newspaper online. National dailies are published each morning except Sunday. Competition between them is fierce. Local daily papers, which are written for people in a particular city or region, are sometimes published in the morning but more often in the early evening.The US has only one national newspaper,  USA Today. The rest are local. A few newspapers from large cities, such as the  New York Times and the  Washington Post, are read all over the country. The  International Herald-Tribune is published outside the US and is read by Americans abroad. Many Americans subscribe to a newspaper which is delivered to their house. This costs less than buying it in a shop. Papers can also be bought in bookshops and supermarkets and most newspapers have online versions.In Britain the newspaper industry is often called Fleet Street, the name of the street in central London where many newspapers used to have their offices. Britain has two kinds of national newspaper: the quality papers and the  tabloids. The qualities were also called the  broadsheets because they were printed on large pages, but are now often in tabloid size which is half the size of a broadsheet. They report national and international news and are serious in tone. They have editorials which comment on important issues and reflect the political views of the paper\u2019s editor. They also contain financial and sports news, features (= articles), obituaries (= life histories of famous people who have just died), listings of television and radio programmes, theatre and cinema shows, a crossword, comic strips, advertisements and the weather forecast.The main quality dailies are The Times and the  Daily Telegraph, which support the political right, The Guardian, which is on the political left, The Independent and The Financial Times. People choose a paper that reflects their own political opinion. Sunday papers include The Sunday Times, The Observer and The Independent on Sunday. The Sunday and Saturday editions of papers have more pages than the dailies, supplements (= extra sections) on, for example, motoring and the arts, and a colour magazine.The tabloids report news in less depth. They concentrate on human-interest stories (= stories about people), and often discuss the personal lives of famous people. People who disapprove of the tabloids call them the gutter press. The most popular are The Sun, The Mirror, The Express and The Daily Mail. The News of the World, a Sunday tabloid, sells more copies than any other newspaper in Britain.There are also local papers, many of which are weeklies (= published once a week). They contain news of local events and sport, carry advertisements for local businesses, and give details of houses, cars and other items for sale. Some are paid for by the advertisements they contain and are delivered free to people\u2019s homes. Some cities also have a daily paper published in the evening, for example, the Evening Standard in London.A daily newspaper from a medium-sized US city has between 50 and 75 pages, divided into different sections. The most important stories are printed on the front page, which usually has the beginnings of four or five articles, and colour photographs. The articles continue inside. The rest of the first section contains news stories, an opinion page with editorials, and letters to the editor, written by people who read the paper. Another section contains local news. The sport section is near the end of the paper, with the features section. This contains comics and also advice columns, such as Dear Abby. There are advertisements throughout the paper.Tabloids contain articles about famous people but do not report the news. They are displayed in supermarkets, and many people read them while they are waiting to pay.On Sundays newspapers are thicker. There are usually fewer news stories but more articles analysing the news of the past week and many more features, including a colour section of comics.Newspapers get material from several sources. Staff reporters write about national or local news. Major newspapers also have their own foreign correspondents throughout the world. Others get foreign news from press agencies or wire services, such as Associated Press or Reuters. Some papers have their own features writers.

By the early 1900s, when railways reached the height of their popularity, there were about 23\u2009000 miles\/37\u2009000 kilometres of railway track. Victorian engineers such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed bridges for the railway, and architects designed elaborate station buildings such as St Pancras in London.The railways played a vital role in Britain\u2019s industrial development during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Later, with the invention of the internal combustion engine (= the type of engine used in cars), road transport became more popular for both goods and passengers. In 1947 regional railway companies were nationalizedand became British Rail (later BR), but following the Beeching report in 1963 many lines (= routes) were closed in order to save money. In 1994 the government decided that BR should be returned to private ownership. Tracks and stations were made the responsibility of a company called Railtrack, while trains were once again operated by several companies on a regional basis. People have been encouraged to use trains and other forms of public transport to help reduce fuel consumption and pollution.The railway network connects all the major towns in Britain, and now, via the  Channel Tunnel, links Britain with France and Belgium. Railways are used for both short and long journeys, for commuting to work each day, and for transporting freight. In 2003 more than a billion journeys were made by rail in Britain and rail travel had increased by 36% in ten years. Some routes are now electrified and have high-speed trains. Others still rely on diesel-powered locomotives. Some trains are old, dirty and overcrowded. They also have a reputation for being late, and jokes are often made about the excuses given for delays. These have included \u2018leaves on the line\u2019 in autumn, and \u2018the wrong kind of snow\u2019. Tickets are quite expensive, although students and old people can get railcards which entitle them to cheaper fares.Following several major railway accidents and the failure of the Railtrack company in 2002 the government set up Network Rail to be responsible for the railway system used by the train operating companies, private companies which run the trains. These companies provide information about trains to the public through their organization, National Rail.Most Americans have never been on a train. This is sad because the railroads, as they are generally called in the US, were the means by which the Old West was settled. Passenger trains today mainly serve commuters around large cities. The only major long-distance railway business is done by freight trains (BrE also goods trains).The first US rail company was the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1828, but its cars (BrE carriages) were pulled by horses. Steam power was used by the 1830s, and the Pullman car was invented in 1856. The Civil War led to the rapid development of railroads, and the nation was connected from east to west in 1869 when the Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific joined their tracks in Utah. The 20th century brought more powerful locomotives and huge stations, like Grand Central in New York. The greatest period of US railroads began in the middle of the 19th century and lasted about 100 years. This time has been celebrated with popular songs like I\u2019ve Been Working on the Railroad, Freight Train Blues,  John Henry,  Chattanooga Choo Choo, Orange Blossom Special and  Casey Jones. Trains and railroad workers were also the subjects of many films and novels.After World War II car ownership greatly increased and people no longer used trains as a means of transport. Union Pacific, once known for its two-level \u2018dome lounge cars\u2019 from which passengers could see the scenery, stopped long-distance passenger services in 1971. Amtrak, a company controlled by the government, now runs the California Zephyr, the Texas Eagle and other trains but it is not very successful in attracting passengers.Some Americans are train buffs and take special steam locomotive trips. Americans also collect model trains, some of which, including the heavy Lionel sets from the 1940s, are now valuable. In Britain old and young alike visit railway museums at e.g. Didcot and York. Trainspotting (= recording the names and registration numbers of locomotives) used to be a popular hobby, especially for boys, but is less common now.","21323":"to ask a question","31214":"the time when sth is strongest and most successful","7125":"connected with teeth","17836":"very impressive in size or quality","17917":"to achieve sth such as a win or a high score","21960":"an act of saying or showing that you will not do, give or accept sth","13384":"to say sth loudly and angrily","14819":"a county in south-east England.

The distance between Boston and San Francisco, for instance, is more than 3\u2009000 miles\/ 4\u2009827 kilometres. The US began to build the  interstate highwaysystem in 1956. By 2004 it had more than 42\u2009000 miles\/(67\u2009578 kilometres of road. The interstate system greatly helped the country\u2019s economy, but it also hurt the economies of many small towns not on an interstate. Interstates running north to south have odd numbers and those going from east to west have even numbers. They often have only two or three lanes in each direction through the countryside but may have eight or more each way through cities. The New Jersey Turnpike, for instance, has 14 lanes each way near New York City.Other major roads in the US are called superhighways, freeways, expressways, thruways or parkways. There are also many county and local roads, called variously arterial roads, feeder roads or farm roads. Some states have tollways or turnpikes, on which drivers must pay a toll.Interstate highways are marked with red and blue signs showing an \u2018I\u2019 followed by the road\u2019s number. Other US highways have red, white and blue signs. Some state roads, like those in Louisiana and Texas, have signs in the shape of the state. Since 1995 states have been able to set their own speed limits. This is usually 65 or 70 mph\/105 or 112 kph on interstate roads but lower on other main roads.In Britain the fastest and most direct routes between major cities are by motorways, which usually have three lanes of traffic in each direction and a speed limit of 70 mph\/112 kph. Each motorway is identified by the letter \u2018M\u2019 and a number. Main roads other than motorways are called A-roads and are numbered A6, A34, etc. Some A-roads are dual carriageways with two or more lanes each way. Most A-roads now follow a bypass round towns. Narrower roads which have only one lane in each direction are called B-roads. Most roads have white lines and Catseyes \u2122 (= objects sunk into the ground that reflect a car\u2019s lights) down the middle. Only a very few roads have tolls but Britain\u2019s first toll motorway, the M6 Toll opened in 2003 as an alternative to the heavily used M6 near Birmingham. Narrow country roads below B-road standard may be known locally by the name of the place they go to, e.g. Orston Lane.In Britain the  Highway Code describes the many signs placed beside roads. Red circular signs give instructions that must by law be obeyed. These include \u2018no overtaking\u2019 signs and signs about speed limits. Red triangular signs give warnings about possible dangers ahead, e.g. slippery roads. Direction signs to major towns are blue on motorways and green on other roads; signs to smaller places are white. Old-fashioned signposts can still be seen in some country areas.In the US red road signs, like \u2018Stop\u2019, must be obeyed. Signs that indicate danger, as in areas where rocks might fall, have a yellow diamond shape. Arrows indicating bends in the road are shown in green circles on white signs. Many other US road signs are now similar to those in Europe.In Britain there is pressure from both business and private road users for more and better roads, despite the damage to the environment and increase in pollution that this may cause. People who are against the building of new roads regularly challenge proposed routes of new motorways or bypasses. If they fail, environmentalistsset up protest camps along the route of the new road. Recently, experts too have cast doubt on the wisdom of building more roads, saying it simply encourages greater use of cars. In the US there are few protests against road-building. People generally want more roads to make their journeys faster and more convenient.","3968":"a warning that is given by the police to sb who has committed a crime that is not too serious","27841":"if sb has a temper, they become angry very easily","6225":"a small bed for a baby which can be pushed gently from side to side","1151":"a section of a large organization that deals with one particular activity","9099":"the activity of digging in the ground to look for old buildings or objects that have been buried for a long time","21996":"the process of going back to an earlier or less advanced form or state","24401":"complete and not mixed with anything else","22730":"of a feeling, etc.","26949":"not very noticeable or obvious","30800":"the intelligence or good sense to know what is the right thing to do","6557":"the tendency of hair to form curls","17685":"a move in which a wrestler stands behind his\/her opponent, puts one or both arms underneath the opponent's arm(s) and holds the back of the opponent's neck.

Metal started to be used for the first time instead of stone to make tools. The skill to make things with metal may have been brought to Britain soon after 2000 BC by the Beaker Folk who were named after the bell-shaped beakers (= cups with wide mouths) found in their tombs. Copperwas used at first, then bronze, a mixture of copper and tin. Tools were made by pouring the metal into a mould. In the latter part of the Bronze Age most settlements (= villages) had their own smiths or skilled craftsmen.Bronze Age people built the impressive stone circles still to be seen at  Stonehenge and other places. The double circle of standing stones at Stonehenge dates from about 2100 BC. Several pairs of stones still have a large, thick horizontal stone across the top of them. The upright sandstone boulders, called sarsens, are thought to have been dug from the ground about 20 miles\/32 kilometres away, but the smaller blue-coloured stones laid across the top come from Wales. It is not known whether they were transported by people using rollersor whether they were left near the site of Stonehenge by glaciers during the Ice Age. In either case, many people would have been involved in building the monument. Stonehenge now attracts a lot of visitors and is a source of wonder and pride. Some people believe that it has a special religious or astronomical meaning and was originally used to calculate when the seasons began and ended.On Dartmoor many stone rows extend in lines for distances up to two miles\/3 kilometres. There are few tracesof Bronze Age houses, though pounds (= areas surrounded by stone walls) on the edge of the moor may have contained groups of houses.In the Bronze Age important people were buried in round  barrows (= piles of earth) made near the top of a hill. Over 20\u2009000 round barrows are known. There was usually only one person buried in each, together with metal goods and pottery.In about 500 BC iron began to be used instead of bronze for making tools, and the period after this became known as the Iron Age.","21957":"a place, person or thing that provides shelter or protection for sb\/sth","9017":"of or belonging to a Christian group that emphasizes the authority of the Bible and the importance of people being saved through faith","25961":"a race in which the people taking part run, swim, etc. very fast over a short distance","30489":"of a liquid","26951":"organized in a clever way","2512":"to lose blood, especially from a wound or an injury","30589":"a long thin piece of rope or leather, attached to a handle, used for making animals move or punishing people","17686":"punishment or defeat that is deserved and cannot be avoided","30947":"a period of physical exercise that you do to keep fit","14194":"the act of sharing or exchanging sth, especially ideas or information","22799":"to cook nuts, beans, etc. in order to dry them and turn them brown; to be cooked in this way","29541":"of a player in a team game, especially football ( soccer )","15475":"(a person) from Libya","31017":"that hurts sb's feelings","22192":"a situation when there is new interest in a particular subject, form of art, etc. after a period when it was not very popular","30172":"the clothes that a person has","10726":"a building or buildings built in order to defend an area against attack","5967":"a region at the south-west tip of England.

By the early 1900s, when railways reached the height of their popularity, there were about 23\u2009000 miles\/37\u2009000 kilometres of railway track. Victorian engineers such as Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed bridges for the railway, and architects designed elaborate station buildings such as St Pancras in London.The railways played a vital role in Britain\u2019s industrial development during the 19th and early 20th centuries. Later, with the invention of the internal combustion engine (= the type of engine used in cars), road transport became more popular for both goods and passengers. In 1947 regional railway companies were nationalizedand became British Rail (later BR), but following the Beeching report in 1963 many lines (= routes) were closed in order to save money. In 1994 the government decided that BR should be returned to private ownership. Tracks and stations were made the responsibility of a company called Railtrack, while trains were once again operated by several companies on a regional basis. People have been encouraged to use trains and other forms of public transport to help reduce fuel consumption and pollution.The railway network connects all the major towns in Britain, and now, via the  Channel Tunnel, links Britain with France and Belgium. Railways are used for both short and long journeys, for commuting to work each day, and for transporting freight. In 2003 more than a billion journeys were made by rail in Britain and rail travel had increased by 36% in ten years. Some routes are now electrified and have high-speed trains. Others still rely on diesel-powered locomotives. Some trains are old, dirty and overcrowded. They also have a reputation for being late, and jokes are often made about the excuses given for delays. These have included \u2018leaves on the line\u2019 in autumn, and \u2018the wrong kind of snow\u2019. Tickets are quite expensive, although students and old people can get railcards which entitle them to cheaper fares.Following several major railway accidents and the failure of the Railtrack company in 2002 the government set up Network Rail to be responsible for the railway system used by the train operating companies, private companies which run the trains. These companies provide information about trains to the public through their organization, National Rail.Most Americans have never been on a train. This is sad because the railroads, as they are generally called in the US, were the means by which the Old West was settled. Passenger trains today mainly serve commuters around large cities. The only major long-distance railway business is done by freight trains (BrE also goods trains).The first US rail company was the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad in 1828, but its cars (BrE carriages) were pulled by horses. Steam power was used by the 1830s, and the Pullman car was invented in 1856. The Civil War led to the rapid development of railroads, and the nation was connected from east to west in 1869 when the Union Pacific Railroad and Central Pacific joined their tracks in Utah. The 20th century brought more powerful locomotives and huge stations, like Grand Central in New York. The greatest period of US railroads began in the middle of the 19th century and lasted about 100 years. This time has been celebrated with popular songs like I\u2019ve Been Working on the Railroad, Freight Train Blues,  John Henry,  Chattanooga Choo Choo, Orange Blossom Special and  Casey Jones. Trains and railroad workers were also the subjects of many films and novels.After World War II car ownership greatly increased and people no longer used trains as a means of transport. Union Pacific, once known for its two-level \u2018dome lounge cars\u2019 from which passengers could see the scenery, stopped long-distance passenger services in 1971. Amtrak, a company controlled by the government, now runs the California Zephyr, the Texas Eagle and other trains but it is not very successful in attracting passengers.Some Americans are train buffs and take special steam locomotive trips. Americans also collect model trains, some of which, including the heavy Lionel sets from the 1940s, are now valuable. In Britain old and young alike visit railway museums at e.g. Didcot and York. Trainspotting (= recording the names and registration numbers of locomotives) used to be a popular hobby, especially for boys, but is less common now.","16398":"(in some European countries but not Britain) a nobleman of high rank between a count and a duke","7453":"a small, usually cheap, restaurant","4089":"a space in the body, in a plant or in a machine, which is separated from the rest","15121":"a device that gives out light in which all the waves oscillate (= change direction and strength) together, typically producing a powerful beam of light that can be used for cutting metal, in medical operations, etc","19891":"to give sth as an explanation or excuse for sth","25507":"a person who writes the words and usually also the music for songs","14483":"(a person) from Italy","1822":"(a person) from Bangladesh","17838":"a person from a family of high social rank; a member of the nobility","22666":"a short repeated pattern of notes in popular music or jazz","7333":"a person who behaves badly, especially a child","12157":"a particular type of musical rhythm","13245":"of a person","10452":"in card games","3627":"having a particular name","14195":"to share or exchange ideas, information, etc","14690":"a person who is an expert in law","1198":"to arrange a group of things in a pleasing way or so that they are in order","5690":"not natural; forced or too controlled","2087":"an animal with a wide flat tail and strong teeth.

Its many bridges, including London Bridge, are a famous sight. The most distinctive is Tower Bridge, which was designed to blend in with the nearby Tower of London.The Tower, which is guarded by the Yeomen Warders, was built in the 11th century. In the medieval period London grew rapidly in size and importance. Westminster Abbey and the Guildhall date from this time, and the Palace of Westminster became the meeting place of Parliament. In 1666 many buildings were destroyed in the Fire of London. This provided an opportunity for architects like Christopher Wren to redesign much of the city. As London\u2019s population increased, new streets, squares and parks were added, and many public buildings. London was heavily bombed in World War II, after which a new cycle of rebuilding began.London is a busy commercial and cultural centre. Many important financial organizations, including the Bank of England and the London Stock Exchange, are located in the area called the City. Part of the old port in east London has been redeveloped as a business centre, called Docklands. In the West End there are theatres, cinemas, museums and shops. Many people who work in London commute by train or bus from the suburbs because buying a house or flat near the centre is very expensive. Different parts of the city are linked by the famous red London buses, black taxi cabs and the London Underground, often called \u2018the Tube \u2019.People from all over the world have been attracted to London and it is now a cosmopolitan, multicultural city. People from other parts of Britain sometimes think that it is very noisy and dirty. Many go there only for the \u2018bright lights\u2019 \u2014 the theatres round Shaftesbury Avenue or the shops of Oxford Street and Regent\u2019s Street. Others take their children to see the sights, such as Buckingham Palace, where the Queen lives, and the clock tower from which Big Ben chimes the hours.

The first were built in Chicago in the late 1880s but they have since been copied all over the world. After 1913 the top few storeysof skyscrapers were often stepped back (= built gradually narrower, floor by floor) to allow more light to reach street level.Many of the most famous skyscrapers are in New York City. The  Chrysler Building, at 1\u2009047 feet\/319 metres, was by far the tallest building in the world in 1930 when it was built. The taller  Empire State Building, 1\u2009250 feet\/381 metres high, was finished the following year. The towers of the  World Trade Center, built in the early 1970s, were about 1\u2009350 feet\/412 metres tall. Many visitors to New York took the ferry to Staten Island so that they could see the Manhattan skyline, the outline of all the tallest buildings in New York.The  Sears Tower in Chicago, built shortly after the World Trade Center, is said to be 1\u2009454 feet\/443 metres high and is currently the tallest building in the US. The Petronas Towers, built in 1996 in Malaysia, are about 1\u2009483 feet\/452 metres tall, though some people in Chicago disagree with the way they were measured and say that the Sears Tower is really taller. But in 2004 the Taipei 101 Tower in Taiwan became the world\u2019s tallest building at 1\u2009660 feet\/507 metres high.By comparison with skyscrapers in the US, those in Britain are rather small.  Canary Wharf, an office building in London\u2019s Docklands, stands only 800 feet\/244 metres high but it replaced Tower 42, also in London, as Britain\u2019s tallest building in 1986. Other skyscrapers in the City of London include the Lloyds Building, designed by Richard Rogers.Skyscrapers which contain people\u2019s homes are, in Britain, usually called high-rises or tower blocks. They became a common feature of British cities when hundreds of them were built to replace slumsin the 1950s and 1960s. Many are 20 or 30 storeys high, and have several flats on each floor. The tallest residential block in Britain is the Shakespeare Tower, part of the Barbican complex in London, which is 419 feet\/128 metres high. At first, high-rises were welcomed because they provided cheap, modern housing but later they were not considered desirable places to live.

A few are given life peerages, some are made  knights, and many others are given lesser awards. The honours lists are published on New Year\u2019s Day (the New Year Honours) and in mid June on the present Queen\u2019s official birthday (the Birthday Honours). At the end of each parliament before a general election, the Prime Minister recommends a list of politicians for the Dissolution Honours.For a long time honours were given almost automatically to senior members of the armed forces and the Civil Service, and to those who had contributed to party political funds. In 1993 John Major announced a reduction in the number of such honours and said that more awards were to be given to members of the public nominated for honours by colleagues and friends, or by people who admire their achievements. The Ceremonial Secretariat receives nominations and draws up a final list which is approved by the prime minister. As well as the names of politicians and businessmen, it contains charity workers, well-known sports and television personalities, actors, musicians, etc, and many ordinary people. Honours are awarded by the king or queen in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace.Many of the honours are associated with one of several orders of chivalry. Some of the orders have different grades of membership, e.g. \u201aknight\u2019, \u201acommander\u2019, \u201aofficer\u2019 and \u201amember\u2019. Many people are given awards in the Order of the British Empire. Famous people may be given a CBE (commander rank) or  OBE (officer rank); people recommended by members of the public are usually given an  MBE (member rank). Some people think the Order of the British Empire should be renamed to get rid of the outdated reference to the Empire, but in 2004 it was decided that the name should not be changed. Most honours allow a person to put the appropriate letters after their name. In addition to these honours there are many medals and decorationsfor bravery, for civiliansas well as for members of the police and the armed forces.In the US there is no system of honours like that in Britain, though a number of medals are awarded for outstanding achievement or for bravery. These include the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal.","25121":"needing sleep; ready to go to sleep","28845":"the act or process of representing sth in a written or printed form","16962":"harm or injury that is done to sb or to their reputation","5674":"a group of related ideas, things or people","6061":"advice, especially given by older people or experts; a piece of advice","27993":"in a pleased or grateful way","7455":"used to represent the sound made by a bell","24430":"(in Kenya) a simple form of language that includes words from English, Kiswahili and other African languages, used especially between young people in cities","22844":"a person who behaves badly, but in a harmless way","20198":"not liking to lend things or share things with others","28518":"on your own; alone","27408":"of a party or an activity","28056":"connected with God or a god","27690":"a state of confusion or lack of order","24666":"to mix cards up in a pack\/deck of playing cards before playing a game","330":"a change in the way a person behaves or thinks","7778":"the sport or activity of diving into water with your head and arms first","7947":"towards the bottom of a hill; in a direction that goes down","258":"the activity or profession of performing in plays, films\/movies, etc","3117":"used to talk to people in church or to talk about the members of a male religious group","29":"the deliberate ending of a pregnancy at an early stage","1142":"sums involving the adding, multiplying, etc. of numbers","17105":"the act or process of changing sth in order to improve it or make it more acceptable; a change that is made","5639":"to use as little of sth as possible so that it lasts a long time","802":"a person who believes that laws and governments are not necessary","5992":"a connection between two things in which one thing changes as the other does","27914":"to end; to make sth end","30164":"not having enough of sth","29646":"a country in south-eastern South America","12919":"arranged in a hierarchy","25681":"for a particular purpose, person, etc","16725":"connected with trade and commercial affairs","5787":"a series of similar items in which each is almost the same as the ones next to it but the last is very different from the first","29282":"used to describe a state in which things are strange and mysterious, or where things are kept secret and do not seem to be part of the real world","238":"related to sound or to the sense of hearing","19605":"a large round stone, metal or wooden post that is used to support a bridge, the roof of a building, etc, especially when it is also decorative","23389":"covered with or containing sand","27702":"a country in East Africa which is a member of the Commonwealth.

Their tower or spire (= a cone-shaped structure on top of a small tower) can often be seen from far away. Churches are used for worship by the Church of England, Roman Catholics and other groups, while some Nonconformist Churches use chapels or halls. The church and church hall, a building used for meetings and Sunday School, were formerly the centre of the community. Now, far fewer people attend church and this has resulted in some churches being closed or used for other purposes such as housing.Cathedrals may belong to either the Church of England or the Roman Catholic Church. Many cathedrals were built as part of a monastery, for example Durham was started in the 11th century by Benedictine monks. Some of these cathedrals are called minsters, e.g. York Minster, and they were originally centres for teaching Christianity. St Chad\u2019s in Birmingham dates from the middle of the 19th century and was the first Roman Catholic cathedral built in England since the Reformation. A cathedral is the headquarters of a  bishop or  archbishop. Canterbury Cathedral is the headquarters of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who is head of the Church of England.Many people visit churches and cathedrals to admire their architecture. In Britain churches are usually built of stone, with a tower or spire at the west end.  Bells are placed high up in the tower and rung by long ropes before services. In villages the church is approached through a gate, sometimes a lychgate (= a gate with a roof over it), which leads into the churchyard where people are buried. The main entrance is usually on the south side. The church porch has a noticeboard and often a seat in it. Cathedrals are large churches, usually built in the shape of a long cross with a central tower. Older cathedrals are often in a quiet grassy cathedral close.The earliest stone churches date from the Anglo-Saxon period (6th-11th centuries). Norman churches, from the 11th and 12th centuries, are massive structures. Rounded arches over doorways and windows are a distinctive feature of Norman architecture. Examples of Norman cathedrals are those at Durham and Ely.The English Gothic style of the 13th-15th centuries is characterized by pointed arches and increasingly ornate designs for the vault. Windows were tall and narrow in the Early English period (13th century), and later, in the Decorated period, had tracery (= lace-like patterns) at the top. In the Perpendicular period (15th century), they were greatly increased in size and filled with stained glass (= small pieces of coloured glass in a lead frame) showing pictures of saints. Ceilings with elaborate fan vaults (= curved strips of stone spreading out from a point, with patterns between them) are supported by flying buttresses that lean at an angle from the wall and form an arch. Salisbury Cathedral is a characteristic Early English building. Exeter Cathedral dates mainly from the Decorated period and Gloucester Cathedral with its fan vaults is typical of the Perpendicular period.Some later buildings, such as St Paul\u2019s Cathedral designed by Christopher Wren, are more like classical temples, with a central dome and spire added. Wren and James Gibbs, designer of St Martin-in-the-Fields, influenced architects in America: Christ Church in Philadelphia is a copy of St Martin. But the modern Coventry Cathedral, designed by Basil Spence in the 1950s, is a hall-like church with narrow stained-glass windows.In the US the earliest churches were one-room buildings made of wood that were used also as schools. Most communities now have several churches in varying styles. Some are made of stone in order to look like old English churches, some are small, plain buildings made of brick or wood, and others are modern buildings with glass walls. Storefront churches are found in shopping streets and look like shops\/stores.","4790":"a small room or a space in a wall with a door that reaches the floor, used for storing things","6128":"polite behaviour that shows respect for other people","20869":"the force that drives sth forward","12659":"a person who makes money by hawking goods","430":"advise  advocate  urge","12449":"the way that sb deals with or treats a situation, a person, an animal, etc","13808":"including a wide range of people, things, ideas, etc","7950":"to become worse or less successful","12246":"of a person or a remark they make","24468":"solid waste matter from the bowels  excrement","4332":"a game for two people played on a board marked with black and white squares on which each playing piece (representing a king, queen, castle, etc.) is moved according to special rules.

The name Gypsy comes from the word \u2018Egyptian\u2019 because Gypsies were once thought to have come from Egypt. Some people now believe that they originally came from India. In the US Gypsies are called Roma, and in Britain they are known as Romanies or travellers, although the name travellers is more often used for Irish travellers, a group in Britain who, like Gypsies, do not live in settled communities but travel about from place to place living in caravans. The traditional language of the Gypsies is Romani, and new words are made up from Romani elements rather than borrowed from English.Roma or Romanies, like many other minority groups, have a strong sense of pride in their identity. In Britain, they are sometimes treated with fear and suspicion by the rest of the population and are often forced to move on from places where they stop.Gypsies usually make money by selling new and second-hand goods. Some collect and sell scrap metal, while others do agricultural work. A few make a living from entertainment and singing. The women are known for selling clothes pegs, \u2018lucky\u2019 white heatheror bunches of flowers. Many meet each year at the Appleby Horse Fair in Cumbria.Gypsies have always been associated with fortune-telling. They can be found at fairgrounds predicting people\u2019s future by reading their palms (= examining their hands) or looking into a crystalball. Because of the mystery associated with their origins and their magical powers, Gypsies have a popular romantic image that conflicts with the reality of families living on dirty caravan sites and being moved on by council officials or the police. Americans have little contact with Gypsies and think of the Roma only as exciting, mysterious people who wear brightly coloured clothes and gold jewellery and have unusual powers. The romantic image was taken up by the US striptease artist, Rose Havoc, who called herself Gypsy Rose Lee on stage. In Britain a character called Mystic Meg used to appear on television each week, dressed in strange clothes and with an extravagant air of mystery, to predict the winners of the National Lottery.","5337":"having enough skill or knowledge to do sth well or to the necessary standard","4977":"used to refer to all members of a group","8472":"an official order or statement given by sb in authority","2156":"light yellowish-brown in colour","3067":"a failure of a relationship, discussion or system","10411":"an impressive act or way of doing sth","19460":"a unit of electromagnetic energy","7163":"to put or lay sb\/sth down in a particular place","4953":"to stop sb in order to talk to them","11239":"small folds that are sewn into a piece of clothing","19626":"to become very sick and weak because you miss sb\/sth very much","26478":"one of the small circles of wool that you make around the needle when you are knitting","5686":"the act of forming sth","2787":"a person who gives their support to sb\/sth, especially in politics","30099":"the best-known book by the US writer Henry David Thoreau.

A statutory company is set up by an Act of Parliament. Many former statutory companies that were managed by the government, such as those responsible for Britain\u2019s railway system and coal industry, have now been privatized (= sold and made into privately-run companies operating for profit), because these are thought to be more efficient.Most commercial businesses in Britain are registered companies. Lists of these are kept by the Registrar of Companies, and company information and accounts are kept at Companies House. Registered companies may be either private companies or public companies. Private companies have a limited number of shareholders (or members), and their shares are not available to the general public. Shares in public companies can be bought and sold by the public on the stock exchange.A limited company, sometimes called a limited liability company, can be either private or public. The liability (= responsibility) of shareholders for any losses is limited to the value of their shares. Private limited companies have the letters Ltd after their name. A public limited company (plc) must offer its shares for sale to the public. Most large companies in Britain, such as BT and Marks & Spencer, are public limited companies. A special type of limited company, the company limited by guarantee, is used especially for charities. Rather than buy shares, its members promise to pay for a share of debts if it fails.Most businesses in the US are corporations, which are similar to British limited companies. People who invest money in them are liable for (= risk losing) only the amount they have invested. Some corporations sell their shares on the stock exchange, but others do not. Small corporations, e.g. family businesses, may be called close corporations. Corporations often have the letters inc. (short for \u2018incorporated\u2019) after their name. The laws about how corporations are formed and should operate vary from state to state.In both Britain and the US, professional businesses like law firmsare often partnerships, which consist of two or more people who own a business and are together responsible for its debts. In a limited partnership \u2018general partners\u2019 run the business and take responsibility for debts while \u2018limited partners\u2019 only invest money.A sole proprietorship is run by one person only. Many small businesses in the US operate in this way because the rules are much simpler than those for corporations. Sole proprietorships do not have limited liability. If the name of the business is not the same as the name of the person who runs it, the letters d.b.a. are used, short for doing business as, e.g. Ted Smith, d.b.a. Ted\u2019s Book Store.","17549":"a group of people with the same language, culture and history who form part of a political nation","5572":"a large company formed by joining together different firms","17428":"of colours, light, etc.","5355":"a word or phrase, especially an adjective or a noun, that is used after linking verbs such as be and become, and describes the subject of the verb.

It was used as fuel in the factories built during the Industrial Revolution and continued to be important until the 1980s. The main coalfields were in north-east England, the north Midlands and the valleys of south Wales, especially the Rhondda Valley. Towns and villages grew around the collieries or pits (= coal mines) and were dominated by the pithead where the lifting machinery was, and by large black slag heaps (= piles of waste material). Poor conditions and low pay led to a long history of industrial trouble and caused miners to play a leading role in the development of the trade union movement.In 1913 Britain produced 292 million tons of coal and employed over a million miners. In 1947, when the mines were nationalized (= brought under government control), there were still about 1\u2009000 collieries and 700\u2009000 miners. Increased use of North Sea oil and gas in the 1970s led to a lower demand for coal. Coal gas was replaced by natural gas. By the mid 1980s there were only 160 collieries and 200\u2009000 miners. Fear of further job losses led to the long and violent miners\u2019 strike of 1984\u20135. In the 1990s there were more pit closures. In mining communities throughout Britain thousands of former miners have struggled to find new jobs. Collieries were returned to private ownership in 1994, and most coal now produced in Britain is sold to the electricity-generating industry. In 2003 just over 11\u2009000 people were employed in mining.Coal mining is important in the US. In 1988 the US produced nearly a fifth of the world\u2019s coal. Most is mined in the Appalachian Mountains. Modern mining techniques used in West Virginia have removed whole mountain tops and destroyed large areas of forest. Coal is used especially in the electricity-generating industry and in the manufacture of steel. In 2002 the US coal mining industry employed about 110\u2009000 workers.","13362":"a person who owns or rents the house that they live in","29160":"to perform acrobatics on the floor, especially somersaults (= a jump in which you turn over completely in the air)","10072":"no longer doing sth or dealing with sb\/sth","10324":"a small sudden, quick movement or hit, for example with a whip or part of the body","13770":"not enough;

People like Jesse James became famous for leading gangs which committed crimes like robbing banks. People involved in organized crime, particularly during the 1920s and 1930s, were called gangsters. The word gang is no longer used to refer to the group known as the Mafia, though members of the Mafia are often involved in gangland killings. Gangs involved in organized criminal activity were less of a problem in Britain, though in the 1960s the Kray twins ran a gang in the East End of London and triads, gangs similar to the Mafia, operate in some Chinese communities in Britain. Criminal gangs involved in human trafficking, bringing people to the UK illegally and making them work for very little pay are an increasing problem.In Britain and the US gang now usually means a street gang, a group of young people in an inner city area. Gangs have their own parts of the city and keep other gangs out of them. They may show which parts of the city they control by tagging, spraying paint in particular designs on the walls in the area. People who belong to such gangs are called gang members. Crimes commonly associated with street gangs include selling drugs and, in the US, drive-by shootings, when they shoot a member of another gang while driving past, often injuring other people at the same time. In Britain gun crime related to rival gangs is increasing. In Britain in the 1960s and 1970s gangs of skinheads caused fear among ethnic minority groups, and in recent years Asian and West Indian gangs have been established in places such as Birmingham and Manchester. Many of these gangs were formed originally to defend the local community, but then became involved in criminal activity.

The upper class consists mainly of members of the aristocracy. The most senior are the  royal family and members of the  peerage. Next below them are  baronets. Baronets have hereditary titles (= ranks passed on in the family from one generation to the next) but, unlike some peers, are not allowed to sit in the House of Lords. Below this there are various orders of knighthood.  Knights are appointed by the king or queen. In medieval times soldiers were made knights in recognition of military service for their local lord. Today, knighthoods and other honours are announced at New Year or on the king\u2019s or queen\u2019s birthday and are given in recognition of distinguished public service or achievement. New knights receive their title at a special ceremony, during which they kneel before the king or queen, who taps them once on each shoulder with a sword. Knights may put Sir (for men) or Dame (for women) before their first name, and are allowed to have their own coat of arms (= a family symbol, usually a design on a shield).The oldest order of knighthood in England, which is also the oldest order of chivalry in Europe, is the  Order of the Garter. There are 25 Knights of the Garter, in addition to the king or queen and the Prince of Wales. Other senior orders of knighthood include the Order of the Thistle, the Order of the Bath, the Order of the British Empire and the Royal Victorian Order. Letters after a person\u2019s name indicate which order he or she belongs to. Other knights are known as knights bachelor.People who have an upper-class family background may be considered as part of the local aristocracy even if they do not have a title. They often have an upper-class accent and Conservative social and political views and are referred to as the county set. Members of the aristocracy are sometimes described as \u201ablue-blooded\u2019, because in former times their veins showed blue through their skin which was pale from not having to work in the fields. They are also referred to informally as \u201athe upper crust\u2019, or more rudely as \u201atoffs\u2019. Formerly, members of the aristocracy could command respect because of their noble birth. Nowadays, people are much more critical of those who inherit honours but who from their behaviour do not appear to deserve them.The US has no formal aristocracy in that there are no families who have been given titles by the head of state. In fact, the Constitution forbids an aristocracy, saying \u201aNo title of nobility shall be granted by the United States.\u2019 Perhaps because of this, Americans are very interested in Britain\u2019s royal family and nobility. There is, however, respect for US families who, though they do not have titles, have wealth and a social position similar to the British aristocracy. Class in the US is, to a large extent, based on money, but some people have more respect for old money (= money, land, etc. that has belonged to a family for many years) than new money (= money that a person has earned by working). The  Boston Brahmins are the old, traditional families of Boston and they, together with groups of old families from other parts of the US, make up a type of American aristocracy.","7457":"to cause slight damage to a car, etc","11496":"continuous giggling that you cannot control or stop","2550":"a mild swear word that some people use when they are annoyed, to avoid saying \u2018bloody\u2019","16336":"an alcoholic drink made by mixing fruit juice with tequila","18821":"a large black and white animal like a bear, that lives in China and is very rare","24232":"extremely happy","3542":"the part of a cigarette or cigar that is left after it has been smoked","21623":"a large US company producing electronic equipment, especially for radio, television and music.

In the 1960s feminism (= the belief that women and men are equal in abilities and should have equal rights and opportunities) became the subject of intense debate when the  women\u2019s lib movement encouraged women to reject their traditional supporting role and to demand equal status and equal rights with men in areas such as employment and pay.Since then, the gender gap between the sexes has been reduced. The Equal Pay Act of 1970, for instance, made it illegal for women to be paid less than men for doing the same work, and in 1975 the Sex Discrimination Act aimed to prevent either sex having an unfair advantage when applying for jobs. In the same year the Equal Opportunities Commission was set up to help people claim their rights to equal treatment and to publish research and statistics to show where improvements in opportunities for women need to be made. Women now have much better employment opportunities than formerly, though they still tend to get less well-paid jobs than men, and very few are appointed to top jobs in industry.Many people believe that there is still a long way to go before women are treated as equals in employment. In education, however, girl\u2019s and women\u2019s opportunities have improved rapidly and in public employment there are policies to increase the proportion of women employed, which is still very low at senior levels.In the US the movement that is often called the \u2018first wave of feminism\u2019 began in the mid 1800s. Susan B Anthony worked for the right to vote, Margaret Sanger wanted to provide women with the means of contraception so that they could decide whether or not to have children, and Elizabeth Blackwell, who had to fight for the chance to become a doctor, wanted women to have greater opportunities to study. Many feminists were interested in other social issues.The second wave of feminism began in the 1960s. Women like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem became associated with the fight to get equal rights and opportunities for women under the law. An important issue was the  Equal Rights Amendment (ERA), which was intended to change the Constitution. Although the ERA was not passed there was progress in other areas. It became illegal for employers, schools, clubs, etc. to discriminate against women. But women still find it hard to advance beyond a certain point in their careers, the so-called glass ceiling that prevents them from having high-level jobs. Many women also face the problem of the second shift, i.e. the household chores.In the 1980s feminism became less popular in the US and there was less interest in solving the remaining problems, such as the fact that most women still earn much less than men. But American women have more opportunities than anyone thought possible 40 years ago. One of the biggest changes is in how people think. Although there is still discrimination, the principle that it should not exist is widely accepted.Feminism has brought about many changes in the English language. Many words for job titles that included \u2018man\u2019 have been replaced, for example \u2018police officer\u2019 is used instead of \u2018policeman\u2019 and \u2018chair\u2019 or \u2018chairperson\u2019 for \u2018chairman\u2019. \u2018He\u2019 is now rarely used to refer to a person when the person could be either a man or woman. Instead he\/she, or sometimes (s)he, is preferred. The title Ms is used for women instead of \u2018Miss\u2019 or \u2018Mrs\u2019, since, like \u2018Mr\u2019, it does not show whether a person is married or not.","11581":"very easily seen","13990":"lacking the qualities of kindness and pity; very cruel","26432":"feelings of disapproval that people have about particular illnesses or ways of behaving","25160":"to become thinner, for example as a result of eating less","24047":"something that happens after an earlier event or as a result of an earlier event","11345":"from or connected with Germany","675":"very great or severe","29788":"a thin layer of minerals or metal contained in rock","27492":"the equipment that you need for riding a horse, such as a saddle and bridle","5459":"a right or an advantage that is given to a group of people, an organization, etc, especially by a government or an employer","17983":"the part of an atom that contains most of its mass and that carries a positive electric charge","11341":"of geometry; of or like the lines, shapes, etc. used in geometry, especially because of having regular shapes or lines","9730":"The FDA also stops the false advertising of such products.

The first slaves, who were considered to be the property of another person and to have no rights of their own, were taken from Africa to North America by the Dutch in 1619 and by the time of the American Revolution (1775) there were 500\u2009000 slaves, mostly in the South. Slaves were taken from Africa in ships in very bad conditions, with many dying during the trip. Once they arrived, they worked mainly on cotton plantations where the quality of their lives depended on the treatment they received from their master.After the Revolution, northern states made slavery illegal, but it continued in the South. It became illegal to bring slaves into the US in 1808, but by then many were being born there, so slave markets continued. In the 1830s opposition to slavery grew from the abolitionist movement, whose leaders included William Lloyd Garrison who published an anti-slavery newspaper, The Liberator and Harriet Beecher Stowe who wrote a famous novel about a slave called  Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin. In 1831 a former slave, Nat Turner organized an uprising of slaves in Virginia and in 1859 a white man, John Brown tried to free some slaves. The work of the Underground Railroad had more effect, trying to help slaves escape to the North, and some people hoped to end slavery by sending slaves back to Africa, creating the new country Liberia in 1822. Laws were made to restrict slavery, but the South wanted it to expand and politicians found it increasingly difficult to agree. In 1820 the Missouri Compromise said that Missouri would be admitted to the US as a slave state (= one where slavery was allowed) and Maine as a free state (= where slavery was not allowed). However, conflict between the North and South increased and in 1861 the slave states left the US, marking the start of the Civil War.After the North won the Civil War and brought southern states back into the US, slavery was ended, but conditions did not improve for many slaves. Some moved to the North, but many of those who stayed in the South continued to work on the plantations where they were paid for their work but didn\u2019t get enough money to pay for food and clothes.The British were also involved in slavery from the 17th century when many slaves were taken from Africa to British colonies in the Caribbean to work on sugar plantations. Many businessmen made a lot of money from the triangular trade between Britain, Africa and the West Indies. They transported cloth and iron goods to West Africa and exchanged them for slaves who were then taken to the West Indies and exchanged for sugar which was taken back to Bristol and other British ports for sale in Europe. The Quakers were among the first people to campaign against slavery and it was made illegal in Britain in 1772, but campaigns led by William Wilberforce and others then grew for the total abolition of the slave trade. It was not until 1807 that it was made illegal for British ships to carry slaves and for British colonies to import them, and slavery was not finally abolished in the British Empire until 1833, when all slaves were set free and their owners were compensated.","23515":"used to suggest that sth is not at all reasonable or likely","28119":"Hair and skin","12213":"increasing in size, amount or degree","30284":"weak and\/or pale","7541":"when a gas or a liquid discharges or is discharged, or sb discharges it, it flows somewhere","14455":"used especially in poetry and names to mean \u2018island\u2019","28861":"relating to transsexuals and transvestites","10824":"a group of people sharing the same profession, interests or beliefs","24758":"to say sth with a sigh","11610":"the attractive, exciting qualities that sb\/sth, especially a rich and famous person or place, seems to have","7597":"to lose the respect of people, usually so that you lose a position of power","23725":"a long roll of paper for writing on","11577":"an organ in a person's or an animal's body that produces a substance for the body to use.

The year is divided into 12 months, with 30 or 31 days in each month, except February, which has 28 days. An extra day is added to February every fourth year, called a leap year, to keep the calendar in time with the moon. A well-known verse helps people remember how many days there are in each month:Thirty days hath September,April, June and November.All the rest have thirty-one,Excepting February alone,Which hath twenty-eight days clear,and twenty-nine in each leap year.The calendar year starts on 1 January, New Year\u2019s Day. The number of each year (2003, 2004, etc.\u2009) represents the number of years that have passed since the birth of Jesus Christ. The year 2000 marked the end of the second millennium (= a period of 1\u2009000 years) since Christ was born. The years before Christ are described as BC (= before Christ), e.g. 55 BC, or BCE (= before the Common Era). The abbreviations AD (Latin Anno Domini, meaning \u2018in the year of the Lord\u2019) or CE (= Common Era) are put before or after the date for the years after Christ\u2019s birth, e.g. AD 44 or 44 AD, but they are not used with years after about 200 AD. Some cultural and religious groups use different calendars: the year 2000 in the Gregorian calendar began during the year 5760 in the Jewish calendar, 1420 in the Islamic calendar and 1921 in the Hindu calendar.The academic year used by schools and colleges in Britain runs from September to July, with short holidays at Christmas and in the spring and a long summer vacation. In the US the academic year runs from August or September to May or June. Many business companies have a financial year (= a period of accounting) that runs from April to the following March. The tax year in the US is the same as the calendar year but the tax year in Britain begins on 5 April. The reason is that in medieval times the calendar year began on 25 March, not 1 January. When the Gregorian Calendar was introduced, an adjustment was needed and 11 days were removed from September 1752. To avoid being accused of collecting a full year\u2019s taxes in a short year, the government extended the end of the tax year 1752\u20133 to 4 April.Many festivals are celebrated during the year. Christmas and Easter are the main Christian festivals. Jews remember Passover and Yom Kippur. Ramadan, a month of fasting, and Eid ul-Fitr are celebrated by Muslims. Diwali, the Hindu festival of light, takes place in October or November, and the Chinese celebrate their new year in January or February.

It had three main dialects: Kentish, Saxon and Anglian. Saxon was the language spoken at the court of King Alfred the Great, who encouraged people to translate Latin books into English, and so it became the main language of literature. Modern standard English, however, developed from Mercian, a variety of Anglian which was spoken in the Midlands. Relatively few Latin words dating back to the Roman occupation of England survived into Old English. After the arrival of the Vikings from the 8th century onwards, many Norse words, e.g. dirt, blunder and squeak, were added to the language.Several written works have survived from the Old English period. Most of these are short religious writings or poems about great heroes. The most famous of these is  Beowulf, composed by an unknown author and written down in the 8th or 9th century. Beowulf is set in 5th-century Scandinavia and tells the story of the hero Beowulf\u2019s battles with the monster Grendel and Grendel\u2019s mother.To modern British people Old English looks at first like a foreign language. It was originally written in runes or runic letters, an ancient alphabet of 24 angular letters, and then in a form of the Roman alphabet that included several of these letters, such as the thorn (\u00fe) for \u2018th\u2019, both voiced \/BrE ; NAmE \/and voiceless \/BrE ; NAmE \/, and the ash (\u00e6). Some Old English words, such as dead, is, brother and and in the following passage from Beowulf, have survived with little change into modern English. Some words become easier to recognize when they are translated, e.g. yldra meaning \u2018older\u2019 and min for \u2018my\u2019, whereas others are completely foreign to us. Word order is also different from modern English.Hro\u00f0gar ma\u00feelode, helm Scyldinga:\u2018Ne frin \u00feu \u00e6fter s\u00e6lum! Sorh is geniwodDenigea leodum. Dead is \u00c6schere,Yrmenlafes yldra bro\u00feer,min runwita and min r\u00e6dbora,eaxlgestealla \u2026\u2019(Hrothgar, protector of the Danes, spoke: \u2018Do not ask about it! There is more sorrow for the Danish people. Aeschere, Yrmenlaf\u2019s older brother, my trusted friend and my adviser, my close companion, is dead \u2026\u2019)Several shorter poems written in Old English have also survived. These include The Seafarer, The Wanderer and The Dream of the Rood, which all have a Christian message. Few authors are known by name, apart from Caedmon, a 7th-century monk, and the 9th-century Northumbrian or Mercian poet Cynewulf. Other authors of the period, such as Alcuin, wrote in Latin.The  Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a history of England beginning with the arrival of Christianity, was probably begun in the court of King Alfred in 891 and was continued in monasteries until 1154. The writers used a wide range of sources for the Chronicle and it is thought to be the first original prose text in English.Old English was replaced by Norman French as the official language of England after the Norman Conquest of 1066, but it continued to be spoken by the ordinary people and, influenced by French and Latin, developed into Middle English, the language of the 12th to the 15th centuries.","10728":"a thing that sb does particularly well","18429":"a spoken exam, especially in a foreign language","11053":"the range of functions that a computer or other electronic system can perform","22378":"a force that stops sth moving or makes it move more slowly","22353":"of a power, a right, etc.","26632":"to mark or cover sth with streaks","22451":"the work of repairing and cleaning an old building, a painting, etc. so that its condition is as good as it originally was","2455":"the crime of demanding money from a person by threatening to tell sb else a secret about them","13244":"a small arch made of metal or plastic, put into the ground","27053":"to call for or try to obtain sth","17410":"a person whose religion is Islam","31115":"(in Chinese philosophy) the bright active male principle of the universe","14390":"happening without the person concerned wanting it to","23334":"a town in Wiltshire, southern England, on the River Avon.
